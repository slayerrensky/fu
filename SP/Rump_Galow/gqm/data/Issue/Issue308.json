i get to it, iâ€™ll rework the css guidelines and also check all the files. thoughts for now:\r\n\r\nno damn discussions about using sass / scss / compass. doesnâ€™t solve any of our problems and will only introduce new ones, plus a barrier to entry.\r\n\r\ngenerally speaking, we follow [googleâ€™s css coding guidelines](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/htmlcssguide.xml).\r\n\r\nno single-line. every rule gets a line. itâ€™s not sorted alphabetically though but by relation:\r\n* position and metrics\r\n* font and color\r\n* effects like box-shadow and border-radius\r\n\r\n\r\nuse tabs everywhere for indentation of course, no spaces (as per the [global coding guidelines](http://owncloud.org/dev/contribute/))\r\nindent blocks depending on the dom structure so itâ€™s easier to see \r\nas soon as 2 apps use the same css, move it into core.\r\nno inline styles, ever.\r\nno leading zeros for decimal values.\r\nno unit when value is 0.\r\nno _underscores, instead use -dashes.\r\nuse only single 'quotes'. \r\nwe should look into using [prefixfree](http://leaverou.github.com/prefixfree/), also see #201.\r\ninstead of using !important, look into fixing the underlying css specificity issue.\r\n\r\nalso, i guess we have to say something about ids and classes. whatâ€™s the latest reason to not use ids in css apart from that you _might_ use the same style again for another element (which is moot in our case of using it for â»listâ« [ex leftcontent] and â»detailâ« [ex rightcontent]).\r\n\r\ncc @raydiation ","closed_by":null}
