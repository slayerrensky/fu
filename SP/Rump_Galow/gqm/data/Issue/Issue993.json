idea from ios apps, probably also used elsewhere: the last entry in the list always says how many items there are in the list, for example â»34 entriesâ«.\r\n\r\nit might make sense to have this as the last entry in files as well, iâ€™m just not sure if it should be the complete number of files also including those of subfolders, or just â»5 folders + 32 filesâ« stating what is in the current level.\r\n\r\nthis would also be cool for other apps like bookmarks @blizzz, contacts @tanghus, mail @deepdiver1975, for the users settings (number of users) and probably more.\r\nand also in the
