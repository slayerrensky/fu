of the warning shown above).\r\n\r\nit could come from some shares which are not accessible anymore (they were on a custom mount, but the files were removed from the filecache i think because the mount.php was removed during upgrade. now i have re-added the mount.php, the files are there again, but the shares are still invalid i think).\r\n\r\nbecause i saw files_sharing directory mentioned, i tried deactivating the sharing app. this made the messages disappear. even reactivating it again didn't make them come up immediately, but after a while they were back.\r\n\r\nthis screenshot shows
