(as defined in the administrator's setting) i just uploaded a couple of files that were much bigger than 2 gb and it says on the web interface that the size of these files is 2 gb. is this a bug or is this how it is supposed to work? i suppose it's quite important for many of the users that they're able to upload files that are bigger than 2 gb in size, at least through the client.\r\n\r\ni'm using the client version 1.4.2.\r\n\r\n[update]\r\nthis still occurs with oc 6.0a and desktop client 1.5.","closed_by":null}
