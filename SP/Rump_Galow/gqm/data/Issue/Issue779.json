http://bugs.owncloud.org/thebuggenie/owncloud/issues/oc-1458\n\nunable to confirm or prove fixed.\n\ndescription:\nafter upgrading from oc2 to the latest and greatest oc 4.0.6 web dav (and cal dav, and ical, basically anything which goes through remote.php) has stopped functioning. searching trough the forums and the bug reports, i have learned that nginx has problems with oc which can be worked around. unluckily i have apache installed.\n\nthe details:\n\nit's a shared hosting at godaddy, linux (cent os?) with apache and php 5.3, my sql db, owncloud 4.0.6 fresh install and also an upgraded oc2: opening the page http://<server>/remote.php/webdav/ is throwing following:\n\nno input file specified.\n\ndavfs2 mounting says following:\n\n/sbin/mount.davfs: mounting failed. 404 not found\n\nusing the old link: http://<server>/files/webdav.php in a web browser i am asked to provide my user and pass, as i do it i also see my folders (without icons however), when i try to open a folder i get \"no input file specified.\" trying to mount with davfs i only got a 404.\n\nnothing customized by the new install.\n\n\nreproduction steps:\n1. install oc 4.0.6 at godaddy shared hosting (can provide test scenario if needed) 2. configure it as usually 3. try to use anything through remote.php\n\n#2 comment posted by gabor aug 24, 21:24\ninstalled 4.0.7 issue remains the same.\n\n#3 comment posted by john nov 06, 18:20\nexperiencing the exact same thing with both 4.0.x and 4.5.x. it is even worse with the 4.5 series since core.css and core.js is provided through remote.php which means the whole app gets unusable. with 4.0 only calendar sharing does not work.\n\ni am in the same situation as gabor, using godaddy shared hosting with php 5.3 + fast cgi. the good folks at go daddy also refuses to remove fast cgi which i expect is the culprit here so it is not really an option either.\n","closed_by":{"login":"karlitschek","id":867445,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/87ce2b4531ee1a0c32b50e0d8f049224?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f06e7098636caebfc9c30c9f52eb905df.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"87ce2b4531ee1a0c32b50e0d8f049224","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek","html_url":"https://github.com/karlitschek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
