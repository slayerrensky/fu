course, i am also affected by this bug.\n\nand, of course, this bug also applies to owncloud 4.0.1\n\n\n#2 comment posted by markus rex jul 27, 22:55\nneeds to be investigated for v4.0.5. might also affect owncloud 2012 to 2012.4 upgrade.\n\n\n#4 comment posted by jean pierre aug 14, 16:19\nit also has affected me when upgrading from 3.0.3 to 4.0.6., both with php-5.3. and php-5.4.\n\n\n#5 comment posted by hubitronic aug 15, 21:49\nyop, same for me, will keep trying by myself, but am quite disappointed i have to admit.\n\n\n#6 comment posted by ryba aug 18, 09:23\non 4.0.7 i've the same problem.\n\nphp 5.3.6\n\n\n#7 comment posted by al bundy nov 19, 21:40\nhello,\n\ni'd like to add that this is still a valig bug for me as of 4.0.9. still stuck with 3.0.2 :-((\n\ni am barred from upgrading to 4.5, too, because i need to have 4.0.9 first as your upgrade docs tell me.\n\nsince there has been no improvement on the issue in more than six months, i'll probably have to parallel-install 4.5 from scratch and try to copy all data (two dozen calendars) over using some dav client.\n","closed_by":{"login":"raydiation","id":195053,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/aa0d7b7302e0d7f4f9513c23b571383a?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2faf0a25e27510f77d97634a6bbe653b13.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"aa0d7b7302e0d7f4f9513c23b571383a","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation","html_url":"https://github.com/raydiation","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
