(because it works fine with the native windows net-use command). but i also tried it with the webdrive-client with the same effect.","closed_by":{"login":"hanibal8","id":4659029,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/34a2130c96228f1d17fa3de96a839777?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f5562e1007c7889b943a42ef7b0e5a283.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"34a2130c96228f1d17fa3de96a839777","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanibal8","html_url":"https://github.com/hanibal8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanibal8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanibal8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanibal8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanibal8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanibal8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanibal8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanibal8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanibal8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanibal8/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
