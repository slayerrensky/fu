fill the space\r\n2. connect the desktop client\r\n3. sync lots of files (i had 20gb vm, and synced 7.5 worth of data - which is doubled by versions to be 15gb)\r\n4. we run out of space\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### server configuration\r\noperating system: opensuse 12.2\r\n\r\nweb server: apache\r\n\r\ndatabase: mysql\r\n\r\nphp version: 5.3.15\r\n\r\nowncloud version: rc3\r\n\r\n### client configuration\r\nbrowser: firefox latest\r\n\r\noperating system:  windows 7\r\n\r\n### logs\r\n#### desktop log\r\n3-08 09:54:22:661 oc_module: sendfile request failed with http status 507!\r\n03-08 09:54:22:661 _csync_push_file: file: c:/users/matt\\owncloud/2.5 gb.zip, command: sendfile, error: no space left on device from errno 28\r\n0\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"schiesbn","id":1589737,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/8912b598c7b32dd25b87fd168e0b06b2?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f0a323047dbe8329db30eae8dbe96e55e.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"8912b598c7b32dd25b87fd168e0b06b2","url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn","html_url":"https://github.com/schiesbn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
