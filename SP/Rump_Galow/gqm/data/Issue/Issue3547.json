expected behaviour\r\nmigration from oc 4.5.11 with the old files_encryption app to the new files_encryption app in oc 5.0.7-pre should convert all existing files to the new app.\r\n\r\n### actual behaviour\r\nmigration from oc 4.5.11 with the old files_encryption app to the new files_encryption app in oc 5.0.7-pre won't convert all existing files to the new app.\r\n\r\nsome files are good and

pr to fix migration problems: https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/3504/files#l1r616\r\n3. doing a upgrade to oc 5.0.7-pre\r\n\r\n### server configuration\r\noperating system: debian
