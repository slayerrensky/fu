(removed functionality)\r\n3. due to 1. contacts can no longer be added to specific address books. (removed functionality)\r\n4. the contents of disabled address books become inaccessible after the upgrade. this is roughly equivalent to a data loss and therefor inacceptable.\r\n5. contact groups of the inaccessible contacts from 3. will show up as undeletable \"ghost\" groups with invisible contacts in them.\r\n6. address books can no longer be temporarily disabled. (removed functionality)\r\n\r\ni would like to stress that such a grave shift in the contacts management paradigm surely might have its good reasons. nevertheless it looks like there has been not much thinking about the fact that this might have severe implications on existing user data and the way users need  things to work. adding support for groups is a good thing. removing almost any support for managing more than one address book is a bad thing. you should at least have thought about providing a migration path like e.g. offering a tool to auto-merge all address books in an account and add their contents to groups named accordingly.","closed_by":{"login":"tanghus","id":533222,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/e625b634822713b2e346ff7c67d26775?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f6d9c90af1c12f5a88e4d5f216bbc1979.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"e625b634822713b2e346ff7c67d26775","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanghus","html_url":"https://github.com/tanghus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanghus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanghus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanghus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanghus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanghus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanghus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanghus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanghus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanghus/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
