love the idea of owncloud and the backends look solid to me, the only thing keeping me from putting on a full scale test right now is the user interface.\r\nthis is a sincere report on the current state of the ui and why it's currently not a viable option for us yet.\r\n\r\nthe current calendar implementation where scrolling flips the view month (or week) is not a good idea, it presents a few practical problems.\r\n\r\n1. the flipping of months/week is so seemless that most \"dumb\" users that have tried it don't even notice they change months sometimes, in particular those who keep touching the mouse wheel by mistake.\r\n\r\n2. i get two scrollbars (firefox 17) and the inner scrollbar for the month view isnt properly aligned. thusly, the day names frequently end up out of side because they simple do not fit the designated scrollarea.\r\n\r\n3. in week-view cannot reach midnight, if i try to scroll up to it i get a flip to the previous week. sometimes this behavior is also true for getting hour 23:00 at the bottom where i get the a flip to next week.\r\n\r\ni don't think there's any good reason to have scrollareas at all. a better concept would be that the calendar scales to fit the current view. if a scrollbar must appear, it should be for the contents alone, not the month/week selection itself.\r\nalso, multiple, nested scrollareas behave very strange on some touch interfaces and are very difficult to handle.\r\n\r\nhere's a few other practical hints that i've gotten as complaints from users:\r\n\r\nhover items don't work well on touch interfaces and sometimes hides vital commands without giving the user any hint on where to find them. sometimes finding where to hover is not easy, i think there are way better sollutions than hover activation to reveal critical functionality.\r\n\r\nfunctions for specific list items are too far apart from the item information. example: filenames are to the far left, functions (download, share, etc) is to the far right. moving the mouse pointer between the far left and far right all the time, all while trying to maintain a straight horizontal movement, becomes very taxing after a while. generally speaking in any convenient ui, functions should be close to the item they are associated with to prevent users having to look and move the pointer to the extreme ends of the screen over and over.\r\n\r\n- dont use scrollareas as a function, it should only be for when content does not fit\r\n- dont do hover to reveal important functions\r\n- dont do multiple level menus (there are none in owncloud, which is good)\r\n- try to keep functions of a certain group clustered together, avoid making the user shift his eyes and pointer back and forth between the extreme ends of the screen\r\n\r\nmaybe all these issues can be resolved in the theme?","closed_by":{"login":"lukasreschke","id":878997,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/f080e75d370a4d8e550983a4898bcf3b?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2ff12e47d5bb5359a9f58e8217413be790.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"f080e75d370a4d8e550983a4898bcf3b","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasreschke","html_url":"https://github.com/lukasreschke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasreschke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasreschke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasreschke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasreschke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasreschke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasreschke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasreschke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasreschke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasreschke/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
