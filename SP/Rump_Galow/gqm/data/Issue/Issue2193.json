(see dropbox for reference.)\r\n\r\nneeding to know where the file was is not as hard as hunting it down in a list of files which are just grouped together because they have in common that they are deleted. recognition is better than recall, and recognizing the folder structure is faster than recalling the file name and find it in a list of randomly assorted deleted files.\r\nif the folder no longer exists there can just be a shadow folder containing that file. if it was renamed then we just have to decide if we shadowfolder the old folder or show the deleted file in the renamed folder (iâ€™d say the latter one).\r\nthe â»deleted filesâ« button would then not put you in a whole different universe, but just be a toggle for showing the deleted files. much like â»show hidden filesâ« on desktop file managers.\r\n\r\ncc @schiesbn @mtrichards #2133","closed_by":null}
