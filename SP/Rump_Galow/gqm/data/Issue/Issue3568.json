folder to the desktop. this is all fine.  \r\n\r\ni then created a text file in analyst relations on user 2's desktop.  that works, it showed up on the server in both accounts.  i then edited the document through the online text editor in user 2's web interface, added the term pooty, and saved it.  the file propagated to user 1's desktop, and to user 1's web interface, but it didn't sync back
