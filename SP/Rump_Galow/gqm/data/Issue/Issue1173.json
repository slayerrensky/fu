than stated here: https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/648 the same issue occurs under oc 4.5.5\r\n\r\ni recently updated an oc-installation from 4.0 to 4.5.2 and now to 4.5.5.\r\n\r\nexpected behaviour:\r\nwhen i upload a file (regardless of filesize), the progressbar ist displayed, walks to the end and then disappears. the turning icon in front for the newly added file should as well be hidden. changing the page should not result in a browser-alert when the upload has finished.\r\n\r\nactual behaviour:\r\nthe turning icon still stays displayed. a javascript error is thrown: \"uncaught syntaxerror: unexpected token [...] core.js:11\" on leaving the page in chrome (e.g. by clicking on \"files\" again) a warning ist diplayed, asking to confirm leaving (not displayed in ff or opera).\r\n\r\ninternet explorer behaves even worse: after completing the upload, the page refreshes and shows a note on top: \"token expired. please reload page.\". the file is not uploaded and disappears upon refresh.\r\n\r\nthe file is completely uploaded in all other browsers.\r\n\r\nmimetype detection seems to work fine, icons for different filetypes are correctly displayed.\r\n\r\nconfiguration:\r\noc-version: 4.5.5\r\nphp version 5.3.10-2\r\njson version 1.2.1\r\nsqlite3 module version 0.7-dev\r\nsqlite library 3.7.12.1\r\nserver seems to be running debian 3.2.0 (phpinfo says \"linux delta 3.2.0-2-amd64\")\r\n\r\naffected software\r\nmac osx/safari (version not known)\r\nmac osx/firefox (version not known)\r\nwin7/chrome 24\r\nwin7/opera 12\r\nwin7/firefox 17\r\nwin7/ie 9\r\n\r\np.s.: for no obvious reason the browser-message about leaving the page is not displayed anymore. i did not change anything, it just doesn't appear. the js-error is still thrown.","closed_by":{"login":"lukasreschke","id":878997,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/f080e75d370a4d8e550983a4898bcf3b?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2ff12e47d5bb5359a9f58e8217413be790.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"f080e75d370a4d8e550983a4898bcf3b","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasreschke","html_url":"https://github.com/lukasreschke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasreschke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasreschke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasreschke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasreschke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasreschke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasreschke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasreschke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasreschke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasreschke/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
