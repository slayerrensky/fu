(my apps use hooks...just in case)\n- does the migration handle database existing data?(sharing, users,caching...)\n","closed_by":{"login":"deepdiver1975","id":1005065,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/bdba071ed68da9ce8edae53c364902ef?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f67e101ad9531b7d25697b76e503e062e.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"bdba071ed68da9ce8edae53c364902ef","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975","html_url":"https://github.com/deepdiver1975","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
