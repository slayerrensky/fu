(sew me for not reading entire forum later)\r\n\r\n\r\nnow before you start asking me all sorts of questions, wich have been asked before, i suggest you read up on what i have posted on oc forum. that would save me the trouble of repeating myself. so here is the post:\r\n\r\nhttp://forum.owncloud.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=15220&p=38941#p38941","closed_by":{"login":"blizzz","id":2184312,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/1898b25a9cb3aa1a0f0febd1359910b9?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2fca03acec6deadf508b75eb0cf9ba036c.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"1898b25a9cb3aa1a0f0febd1359910b9","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz","html_url":"https://github.com/blizzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
