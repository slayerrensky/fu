it seems that for me they happen quite often - for example when i change any mount.php, or obviously when updating.","closed_by":{"login":"karlitschek","id":867445,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/87ce2b4531ee1a0c32b50e0d8f049224?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f06e7098636caebfc9c30c9f52eb905df.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"87ce2b4531ee1a0c32b50e0d8f049224","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek","html_url":"https://github.com/karlitschek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
