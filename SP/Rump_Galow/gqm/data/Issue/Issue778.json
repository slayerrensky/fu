http://bugs.owncloud.org/thebuggenie/owncloud/issues/oc-1984\n\n@arkascha also commented.\n\ndescription:\non irc, #owncloud two users mentioned problems with file uploads failing in oc-4.5 when using ms-ie browsers version 8 and 9. other browsers are said to upload without problems. error message visible in side the browser: \"token has expired. please reload.\" i was able to reproduce the problem.\n\napparently there is a problem with the csrf protection token not being send by the browsers. thus the validation obviously has to fail. i checked the client side, the token is present and used as expected for ajax calls, but aparently not for this file upload. i assume the difference between browser behaviour results from using different upload strategies. the code is in apps/files/js/files.js, lines 203 and following. that code is too complex for me to quickly spot the problem. i guess it makes sense if the author himself could take a look at this...\n\n\nreproduction steps:\nopen the files app inside a oc-4.5 installation using a ms ie browser, version 8. perform a file upload, you see the file being uploaded and removed again right away. the error message is shown as mentioned in the report.\n\nthis behaviour is different to when other (non ms ie) browsers are used.\n\n#3 comment posted by christian reiner oct 12, 10:59\nthere also is
