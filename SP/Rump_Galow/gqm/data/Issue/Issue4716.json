just saw a minor problem in the apps adminstration in oc-6-alpha: \r\n\r\nan app failed to install correctly (due to changes in the environment). most likely the app got 'installed' only half...\r\nnow when i reopen the 'apps' selection page that app is shown different: \r\n1.) it appears further down in the list (why that?)\r\n2.) the info has changed, not recommended any more (which actually makes sense, but is coincidence)\r\n3.) when selecting the app for activation you get an additional button \"update to\" (which certainly does not make sense)\r\n\r\nsee the attached screenshot...\r\n\r\nthe apps folder was present inside the app subfolder (shouldn't it get removed again, when the app fails to get activated correctly?) once removing that folder everything is back to normal again. so it appears the routine that scans the installed apps really stumbles over this...\r\n\r\nplease note that i am not reporting the fact that this app currently fails to install. that is a separate issue that has to be solved separate.
