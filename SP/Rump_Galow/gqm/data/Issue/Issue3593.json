detect that a directory was not changed, it would be good if (at least) every directory could provide a unique id through a propfind on the directory. the id must never change, also not on rename.\r\n\r\nthe usecase is that clients will store the id and use to detect if it's still the same id or if the directory has changed. in that case the client journal needs to be deactivated.\r\n\r\nthis is an enhancement that we need to detect if people removed the server dir and recreated it with  the same
