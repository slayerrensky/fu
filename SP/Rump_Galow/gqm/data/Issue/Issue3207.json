oc 5 latest version with mysql on ubuntu 12.04 lts when mounting a large smb mount (in this case 2tb) the initial file scan can take days (in this case 3-5 days of having the browser open to finish the scan).  while this is happening there does not seem to be any way for the user to access the system and other files that are on the system.\r\n\r\nis there anyway to do this indexing in the background and allow the user to access files while this large index job is happening?\r\n\r\nif any other details of the install are needed, or if specific logs are required please let me know!\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nbboule","closed_by":null}
