explanation of issue:\r\nwhen removing css properties in e.g. styles.css from a custom theme, these properties are still loaded from the original styles.css breaking the concept of custom themes.\r\n\r\nlong explanation of issue:\r\n\r\ni had the intention to create a clean owncloud theme with basic functionality working in modern browsers only. this includes removing vendor specific extensions, unnecessary fancy css code and also removing alot of css that is not w3c standard conform.\r\n\r\nas i understood (note: this is not how it works) the theming concept, i did the following and thought it would work:\r\n\r\ni created a folder \"../themes/mytheme/core\" and added a line to the config.php \"'theme' => 'mytheme'\". this worked.\r\n\r\ni then uploaded a file named styles.css to ../themes/mytheme/core/css/styles.css and thought that this file from now on will control the look and feel of the site and that the original file ../core/css/styles.css will be ignored now.\r\n\r\nhow theming really works:\r\nactually what i did will only work as long as i change existing values (they will simply be overwritten by my value despite the original value still existing and being processed unecessarily).\r\nhowever when i remove just one property e.g. a vendor specific extension (there are even some ie6 hacks in the current css which really need to go away) \"mytheme\" will still contain this css property.\r\ndespite the property not existing in ../themes/mytheme/core/css/styles.css it will still be loaded from ../core/css/styles.css although i have configured a custom theme.\r\n\r\nthis is a conceptual error in my opinion, because it breaks the whole idea of custom themes. it essentially means you have two options:\r\n\r\n1) you are limited to changing existing values, but you cannot remove them, meaning that unbloating the standard theme is impossible by this method.\r\n\r\n2) you can replace the files in ../core/ directly instead of using the option to add a custom theme. since this is not within the concept of theming anymore, but rather replaces owncloud base files, this will cause more issues when upgrading to a new version.\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat should be changed / made possible to fix the issue:\r\nwhen i create a custom theme and upload a file e.g. ../themes/mytheme/core/css/styles.css this and only this file should be used for my theme, completely ignoring the original file in ../core/css/styles.css.\r\n\r\nthis can either be made possible by changing the way theming works or by adding some override function that allows developers to let theming work the way it is now, but optionally also completely override original files and not just properties.","closed_by":{"login":"jancborchardt","id":925062,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f84ec51f9ceed468217d4e13abf78da9c.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt","html_url":"https://github.com/jancborchardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
