am quite unsure if this is really an issue, but i am in need of advice here:\r\n\r\ni have moved my oc installation to a new server, on that, the filesystem layout has changed. i did not do anything else but changing the datadir config variable. it seems, that this change had a few strange effects, first, looking at the oc_storages table, i get this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmysql> select * from oc_storages;\r\n+-------------------------------------------------------+------------+\r\n| id                                                    | numeric_id |\r\n+-------------------------------------------------------+------------+\r\n| local::/var/xxxxxxx/xxxxxxx/xxxxx/data/user1/        |          1 |\r\n| local::/var/xxxxxxx/xxxxxxx/xxxxx/data/user2/        |          2 |\r\n| local::/var/xxxxxxx/xxxxxxx/xxxxx/data/admin/         |          3 |\r\n| local::/var/www/xxxxxxx/xxxxxxx/xxxxx/private/user1/ |          4 |\r\n| local::/var/www/xxxxxxx/xxxxxxx/xxxxx/private/user2/ |          5 |\r\n| home::admin                                           |          6 |\r\n+-------------------------------------------------------+------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\ninterestingly, there are still files accociated to the old storage locations, as i am getting errors like the following in the oc log, appearantly from the antivirus engine:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"app\":\"files_antivirus\",\"message\":\"scanning file : files\\/clientsync\\/somefilename.xlsx\",\"level\":0,\"time\":\"2013-11-17t11:44:03+00:00\"}\r\n{\"app\":\"php\",\"message\":\"fopen(\\/var\\/<old location>\\/data\\/ludwig\\/files\\/clientsync\\/somefilename.xlsx): failed to open stream: no such file or directory at \\/var\\/www\\/clients\\/client1\\/web27\\/web\\/lib\\/files\\/storage\\/local.php#146\",\"level\":2,\"time\":\"2013-11-17t11:44:03+00:00\"}\r\n{\"app\":\"files_antivirus\",\"message\":\"file could not be open.\",\"level\":3,\"time\":\"2013-11-17t11:44:03+00:00\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nis there anything i have to do after moving the storage to a new location, if yes, what?\r\n\r\n\r\nbest regards,\r\ntorben nehmer\r\n\r\nbtw: is it possible, that this is somehow related to the redownload-bug of the csync tool (https://github.com/owncloud/mirall/issues/994) i am not sure if the redownloading also happened on the old server.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"karlitschek","id":867445,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/87ce2b4531ee1a0c32b50e0d8f049224?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f06e7098636caebfc9c30c9f52eb905df.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"87ce2b4531ee1a0c32b50e0d8f049224","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek","html_url":"https://github.com/karlitschek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
