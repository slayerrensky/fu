e.g. the       warning php above just showed my password clearly. its a really huge security bug in my opinion, i mean just think about sitting in your office clicking on the       administration someone enters and just can check your passwords ...\r\n\r\n- sharing of local and smb mounted folders/files:\r\n\t- folders which should get shared get corrupt foldernames on the shared accounts. it looks like the folder name are like whitespace and caused by this if two folders getting shared u got like whitespace (2)\r\n\t- no write rights on shared folders doesn't matter if i checked just everything (full rights) or not.\r\n\t- doesn't show any files\r\n- music app:\r\n\t- if clicking on a track, the label of the timeline gets shown first on a bad position i think (depening on your browser and scale of the windows, e.g. right on top of \t  the volume-symbol).\r\n\t- i dunno how to call this \"bar\" where the play/stop-buttons are, i'll call it headerbar - could get a little bit nicer. in my opinion this controls are out of position. putting them all on the same height would be nicer.\r\n\t- the library looks totally corrupted. there are no columnheaders but it seems like having 3 columns to be able to klick. the first one always showed me unknown. well \t\t  and what's meant with unknown? if i add the tracks to the list the right songnames are getting shown in the playlist on the left side. well i uploaded 3 default tracks of windows7 and i get one entry unknown like i said. adding \t  all 3 tracks to playlist works fine.\r\n\r\nedit: if just giving other members access on mounted folders too its the same like on top: smb mount.\r\n\r\n  log (translated on my own):\r\n\t[thu may 23 11:16:17 2013] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] directory index forbidden by options directive: /srv/www/htdocs/\r\n        ls: cannot access oc://admin/files/maid with the flaxen hair.mp3: file or directory not found\r\n\tls: cannot access oc://admin/files/sleep away.mp3: file or directory not found\r\n\tls: cannot access oc://admin/files/kalimba.mp3: file or directory not found\r\n  \r\n  original log:\r\n\t[thu may 23 11:16:17 2013] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] directory index forbidden by options directive: /srv/www/htdocs/\r\n\tls: cannot access oc://admin/files/maid with the flaxen hair.mp3: datei oder verzeichnis nicht gefunden\r\n\tls: cannot access oc://admin/files/sleep away.mp3: datei oder verzeichnis nicht gefunden\r\n\tls: cannot access oc://admin/files/kalimba.mp3: datei oder verzeichnis nicht gefunden\r\n\r\n- contacts app:\r\n\t- it looks like the list who shows your contacts got 4 columns. again here, no column headers, and all columns are just empty. if i click sometimes nothing happens and sometimes the edit contact dialog popps up.\r\n- calendar app:\r\n\t- if clicking on an event, just getting shown the name of the three tabs (info, repeat, share) of the following opening dialog were shown on the left side of the bottom. i think thy shouldn't been shown there too, right?\r\n\r\nso far, i hope i could help out maybe finding a few unknown issues.\r\nregards\r\nyaerox","closed_by":{"login":"tanghus","id":533222,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/e625b634822713b2e346ff7c67d26775?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f6d9c90af1c12f5a88e4d5f216bbc1979.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"e625b634822713b2e346ff7c67d26775","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanghus","html_url":"https://github.com/tanghus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanghus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanghus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanghus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanghus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanghus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanghus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanghus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanghus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanghus/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
