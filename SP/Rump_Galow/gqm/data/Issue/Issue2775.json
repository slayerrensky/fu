expected behaviour\r\nwhen dragging files from windows explorer onto a newly created subfolder that is below the very top level, i.e. a \"css\" folder or \"images\" folder below the main \"website\" folder that i am currently viewing, the files should upload and the spinning icons should stop spinning once done. opening the css or images folders below, should show the newly uploaded files. \r\n\r\n### actual behaviour\r\nwhen dragging files from windows explorer onto a newly created subfolder that is below the very top level, i.e. \"css\" folder or \"images\" folder below the main \"website\" folder, owncloud produces a \"not enough storage available\" error and the process hangs. trying to do anything at this point in time, produces a \"are you sure you want to leave this page?\" pop-up. the files are not uploaded.\r\n\r\n### steps to reproduce\r\n1. create a folder within the top folder, i.e. \"website\". \r\noptional: 1.1. upload some files to this folder. \r\n2. create a new subfolder called \"css\" within the top \"website\" folder, but do not open it. \r\n3. drag files from windows explorer onto the \"css\" folder inside the web interface.\r\n4. watch the spinning icons and the error message :)\r\n\r\n### server configuration\r\noperating system: windows 7\r\n\r\nweb server: iis\r\n\r\ndatabase: mysql\r\n\r\nphp version: 5.3.23\r\n\r\nowncloud version:
