unsharing files (by clicking on the x at the right) works fine and as expected.\r\n\r\nwhen you unshare a directory, it does not disappear. instead you keep seeing the 'shared\"-folder plus the \"unshared\" folders in there. when you then click on a directory (previously unshared) you are dropped into the owncloud root folder.\r\nand you can start over.\r\n\r\nreproduction:\r\n1. set up an instance with 2 users and some files and directories in there. nothing fancy.\r\n2. log in as user2 (webfrontend)\r\n3. share a few files and directories from user2 to user1.\r\n4. log in as user1 (webfrontend)\r\n5. in the shared folder unshare a few files and directories (click the x on the right) \r\n-> the files and the directories are unshared and disappear as they should. but when you go
