(this is setup correctly since all other php applications doesn't have any issues at all). after i have setup in handler mappings to use php-cgi.exe, i have putted src file of owncloud version 5.0.11 in inetpub folder. after i setup to use mssql server and put admin login, oc created the database and created new user. i have successfully logged on to admin user, and i found that oc created folder admin in data folder in parent directory. after i've created new user - \"user\" and new group called \"users\", i have added default space to 5gb. next step is to login on client pc with newly created user. after i did that, cpu load jumps to 100%, and i have also noticed that folder with another user is not created (in data folder). i have checked the database tables and saw that user exists... it looks to me that after trying to log-in with new user, i get stuck in redirection loop or something... unfortunately i haven't found any errors in logs... does anyone have similar issues as me?\r\n\r\nrequirements: \r\n- windows server 2008 r2\r\n- mssql standard 2008 r2\r\n- owncloud 5.0.11 version\r\n- php 5.1.16 version\r\n\r\np.s. btw i have tried to setup newest versions of php but i got same issues...\r\n![capture1](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/5610563/1268663/0fd6a73a-2ce5-11e3-806e-0d66c8219b2a.png)\r\n![capture2](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/5610563/1268665/1001f836-2ce5-11e3-82e2-09a829930507.png)\r\n![capture3](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/5610563/1268664/0ffb35b4-2ce5-11e3-9871-098a66ac4321.png)\r\n![capture4](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/5610563/1268668/1001fb60-2ce5-11e3-9744-631f9aed4f30.png)\r\n![capture5](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/5610563/1268666/10012d48-2ce5-11e3-9763-a171b7147739.png)\r\n![capture6](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/5610563/1268667/1001dd2e-2ce5-11e3-9e5b-aebd79128db0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"vtravalja","id":5610563,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/6b8002e7e2145c93de71d599691acc8a?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2fee4f14a41e67217bf98dc7c7e69fea4d.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"6b8002e7e2145c93de71d599691acc8a","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtravalja","html_url":"https://github.com/vtravalja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtravalja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtravalja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtravalja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtravalja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtravalja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtravalja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtravalja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtravalja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtravalja/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
