although this issue addresses apps i post this in the 'core' section by purpose, since i think this is more of a core issue. \r\n-----\r\n\r\nowncloud offers apps from the app store for installation (\"activate\" inside the app selection). the list of apps from the store is filtered for this purpose. there are many rumours about the magical spells one has to say at midnight in a weezy corner to get an app to comply with these filter rules. currently i wonder this: \r\n\r\nwhy is the new \"fluxx compensator (y)\" not offered for installation inside oc-5.0.0-beta1 ?\r\n\r\ni traced this down and came to this filter url: \r\nhttp://api.apps.owncloud.com/v1/content/data?categories=920x921x922x923x924x925&sortmode=new&page=0&pagesize=100&filter=approved&version=4x93x10\r\nit lists a long set of available apps, the one is question is _not_ amongst them. of course not. but why? \r\n\r\nthe problem is _not_ that the app requires oc-5 on store level, i changed it to test, but without success. the apps internal info.xml description further requests oc-4.91 whilst 5.0.0-beta1 calls itself 4.93. but the app does not show up. so i tried around a little...\r\nchanging the filter url to 4.91 does not succeed, still no glimpse of the app. \r\nchanging it to 4.90 suddenly works, the app is listed. \r\n\r\nwtf?\r\n\r\nso the app store offers an app only when the oc version number is _smaller_ than the version the app actually requests? i thought this insane logic had been changed long ago? so older oc-versions are offered that app, newer not? what sense does that make? even with an exact match there is no success!
