you want to quickly grab your server log files, easiest way is to copy them to owncloud, then download them.  while i can copy them to /owncloud/data/user/files, when i look at them in the web client i cannot edit them.  i changed ownership and permissions to match the other files.  i still can't rename them.  i can only download and only share them with the option to \"share\", the update and delete options are gone.  i also cannot delete the text file through the web client interface.  \r\nsuse 12.2, owncloud 4.5.0.\r\n\r\nif i rename the file at the command line to something that ends in .txt, then i have all of my file options back.\r\n\r\n\r\nto recreate:\r\n\r\n1. grab the text error log from the web server (apache)\r\n2. copy it to the /owncloud/data/user/files directory\r\n3. file shows up, but try to edit the name, or open it in a text editor\r\n4. try to share it, but \"can edit\" is not an
