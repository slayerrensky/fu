or check out the screenshots. they are taken with my 12\" 1280*800 chromebook so you see it works very well even with smaller screens/resolutions, and lots of apps fit in there:\r\n\r\nfiles currently:\r\n![owncloud nav old files](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/925062/395614/dc2e1b38-a806-11e2-90d4-c1bb51ec70e4.png)\r\nfiles with the new design:\r\n![owncloud nav new files](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/925062/395616/dc6eb134-a806-11e2-9465-cbfdc2741243.png)\r\nyou see it allows much more room for the app itself. this is even more important as files will/should also get a sidebar (#1936).\r\n\r\nnow an example with an app which already has a sidebar. currently that feels strange because there are 2 left hand navigation bars:\r\n![owncloud nav old notes](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/925062/395617/dca7c0f0-a806-11e2-859b-f655b89f442a.png)\r\nnow itâ€™s much simpler:\r\n![owncloud nav new notes](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/925062/395615/dc6d5f00-a806-11e2-944d-16995ec8a0d6.png)\r\nmany apps already have this left-hand navigation (contacts, news, notes, bookmarks, tasks, music, mail) and we want to introduce it for some other apps too (files, calendar, â€¦). we have default styles for that in core already which are used by notes and news.\r\n\r\n\r\nfunnily enough, even with the search bar and username there, the navigation overflows earlier with the left bar than it does with the new design. in case of overflow there will _not_ be a horizontal scrollbar (hope you didnâ€™t think i planned that ;) but rather a â»moreâ« entry with a dot-dot-dot icon which then opens a popover showing the remaining apps. this is similar to what google+ does, or the android top bar. although, itâ€™s very unlikely to overflow at all as you see from the above screenshots.\r\n\r\n@karlitschek hope that sufficiently explains why i think itâ€™s a necessary change, not just an opinion or redesigning for the sake of it. ;)\r\n\r\n@mtrichards @raydiation @raghunayyar @butonic: what do you think?\r\n\r\ncheck this out but please do not merge it in yet!","closed_by":{"login":"jancborchardt","id":925062,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f84ec51f9ceed468217d4e13abf78da9c.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt","html_url":"https://github.com/jancborchardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
