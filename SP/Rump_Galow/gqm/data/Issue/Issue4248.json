(i have this working at a customer for oc4.5, so i just need to port it.)\r\n\r\ncurrently, owncloud deals with files in the first place. a search result should therefore take you to the resource. @jancborchardt i know this is different than the \"open in specialized app\" approach, but i am trying to find an intermediate solution. maybe we can add a folder icon to the search results that will always take you to the files app, while clicking somewhere else on the result will open the specialized app.\r\n\r\nhave a look at this mockup:\r\n![search_result_mockup](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/956847/880210/ab59170c-f936-11e2-8689-b32e5c824af5.png)\r\nthe files should show the mimeicon instead of 'music', 'text', 'calendar' or 'folder'. now that i look at it, the mp3 should show the song meta tags and the image exif data if available. the greyed out folder is only visible when hovering over a file and will take you to the containing folder, highlight the file and scroll it to top as described above. clicking anywhere else in a result will take you to the specialized app if available. also, i forgot to add a scrollbar to fix #4236. \r\n\r\nthis changes the way audio files are handled, because this would also show you all songs.\r\n\r\ncontacts, calendar entries and similar are unaffected because no file based representation exists.\r\n\r\n@karlitschek @jancborchardt @deepdiver1975 @icewind1991 @bartv2 @raydiation @andrewsbrown opinions? ideas? feedback?","closed_by":null}
