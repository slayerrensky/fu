or are both used?). versioning app is enabled, and the checkbox in the admin section is also checked. there are no errors in either owncloud or server log i could relate to this phenomenon.\r\n\r\ni can not reliably link this problem to a specific upgrade; it could have started at either  the 4.0.8 -> 4.5 upgrade or the 4.5. to 4.5.1a update.\r\n\r\nsee also this forum thread: http://forum.owncloud.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=4569 - it has some info on what i tested specifically (i tested both upload via client and web interface). if more info is needed i'd be glad to provide it.\r\n\r\ni'm not 100% sure on the expected behavior here, but my expectation would be:\r\nin the web interface, whenever i upload a file with the same name, and choose to overwrite the existing one, a new version gets created\r\nvia the client, whenever i change a file, and this file is synced to the server, a new version is created\r\nwhenever i edit a file (e.g. text file) on the server, and store it, a new version gets created\r\n\r\nthat's how i would expect versioning to work - and for me, none of the above works at the moment.","closed_by":{"login":"schiesbn","id":1589737,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/8912b598c7b32dd25b87fd168e0b06b2?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f0a323047dbe8329db30eae8dbe96e55e.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"8912b598c7b32dd25b87fd168e0b06b2","url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn","html_url":"https://github.com/schiesbn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
