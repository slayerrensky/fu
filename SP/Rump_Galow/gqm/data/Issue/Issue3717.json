the maximum zip download size is set to 0, owncloud regards this as unlimited. however, a shared folder will no longer show a download link (presumably because it does not properly assume unlimited size when size is 0).\r\n\r\nto reproduce the bug, \r\n* create a shared folder with large files in it, and copy the public url. \r\n* set the maximum zip size to 0 in the administration section. \r\n* open another browser (or use incognito or logoff) and go to the shared url. you will see there is no \"download\" link on the top right. \r\n\r\nnote that this is only for the currently displaying folder. if there are subfolders, those still have the download link when viewed from the parent, just as files would. if you traverse into those folders, though, there is again no link to download the currently displayed folder as a zip in the top right (which is a problem if you want to download the entire shared folder, ie the root).\r\n\r\nto overcome the limitation,\r\n* change the maximum zip size to a size larger than the folder. \r\n* refresh the page with the shared url, and the download link appears.\r\n\r\ni am running owncloud v5.0.12 on debian 6 (squeeze), using firefox or chrome (though this is likely browser agnostic).\r\n\r\nfor now, i am able to overcome this limitation by using a large maximum size (ex 4gb) instead of unlimited. the shared folder shows a download link, since it is under the maximum.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kabum","id":245432,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/a1dea19f88f38ea0b5b5b4d19d5b3107?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f53d8cbb3dbc087a02951dec47438ccdf.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"a1dea19f88f38ea0b5b5b4d19d5b3107","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kabum","html_url":"https://github.com/kabum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kabum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kabum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kabum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kabum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kabum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kabum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kabum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kabum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kabum/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
