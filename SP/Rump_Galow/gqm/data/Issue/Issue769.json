a file copy of one(!) file takes about 1 minute, independent from filesize -> seems to run in several timeouts/loops\n\nby using another web dav client like cyberduck or transmit on the same os x instance, it's much faster but not as fast as connecting e.g. to the demo.owncloud.org server.\n\nby accessing the same server from a virtual ubuntu 11.04 instance running in vbox on the same mac as web dav client, speed is pretty fast! by accessing the nas's built-in web dav implementation from osx finder, everything works pretty fast and reliable\n\n=> so, a hardware bottleneck can be excluded for sure!\n\nif quota wasn't set in owncloud, file upload will be done anyway, but results in empty file (until web dav reconnect)\n\nc) after quota being set, owncloud 3rc1 uploads sporadically result in zero byte filsize (more large files than small files). no problems again with cyberduck!\n\n2. server: own cloud 2.x and 3rc1 on ubuntu 11.04 in vbox on mac os x 10.6 (quad core i7), client: mac os x 10.6.8 and 10.7.2\n\na) file upload via finder/webdav: file copy pretty fast, but reproductively results in empty files (even if quota is correctly set in owncloud, independent from filesize)\n\nby accessing from the (local) ubuntu web dav client, copy works appropriately w/correct filesizes\n\nmaybe osx/finder behaves quite fussy in terms of dav specs and so is running into various problems...?!??\n\n\nreproduction steps:\nsetting up system configurations as described above\n\n\n comment posted by rgr101 jan 24, 14:44\nin the meantime, i have investigated a bit deeper:\n\nseems indeed to be a finder issue (see e.g.http://code.google.com/p/sabredav/wiki/finder) -\n\nfound an alternative for finder on the mac, called fork lift: own cloud and non-owncloud web dav connections are pretty fast and work without any zerobyte issues (but be aware of the \"mounting\" option using mac fuse -- nice feature but doesn't work since forcing massive cpu load and hanging...)\n\nnevertheless, this finder related issue redounds upon owncloud anyway, since these problems seem to appear only that massively in conjunction with an owncloud web dav connection...\n\n#6 comment posted by sideshowralphwiggum mar 02, 19:05\ncommenting out line 586 as below:\n\n// throw new sabre_dav_exception_preconditionfailed('the tokens provided in the if header did not match','if');\n\nin owncloud/3rdparty/sabre/dav/locks/plugin.php stops the zero-size issue.\n\nit's still slow to copy files from a mac, but at least the files get across.\n\ni really hope owncloud looks into this sabre problem soon. how i wish they would have just used apache's web dav. it's proven, and doesn't name the share \"webdav.php.\"\n\n#7 comment posted by daveqb apr 24, 03:00\ni have the same issue here.\n\nthanks for the fix guest #3\n\n#8 comment posted by pheraph  may 27, 13:18\nsame here, uploading is broken in lion. tried the suggested fix, but upload is still broken.\n\n#9 comment posted by oberling may 29, 20:54\nthanks sideshow ralph wiggum - although it's on line 539 for me (stable 4.0.0). fixed the issue for me but left me with a \"not-so-good-feeling\" commenting out some error-reporting line... but ok ;) .\n\n#10 comment posted by pheraph jun 06, 08:34\nas written commenting out the given line (3rdparty/sabre/dav/locks/plugin.php:539) doesn't fix the 0-byte issue for me with the finder on osx 10.7.4, owncloud 4.0.1 (i noticed the iwork-apps on ios are able to connect through web dav.)\n\n#12 comment posted by tim oct 01, 10:37 \ni still see the same issue(s) with owncloud 4.0.7 and os x 10.8.2. is there any solution in sight? is anyone working on this?\n\n#13 comment posted by pheraph oct 10, 11:43\ndoesn't seem to be high priority. smileys/4.png\n\n#14 comment posted by sergi almacellas abellana nov 06, 16:20\nsame problem in owncloud 4.5, mac os x.\n\nworks fine from linux webdav client.\n\n#15 comment posted by fenris nov 26, 17:02\nsame problem. owncloud 4.5.2. os x 10.7.5 and various os x 10.6\n\nexceptionally slow file transfers.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jancborchardt","id":925062,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f84ec51f9ceed468217d4e13abf78da9c.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt","html_url":"https://github.com/jancborchardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
