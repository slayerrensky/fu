discussed via email cc @msrex @mtrichards @karlitschek @schiesbn:\r\n\r\nafter you undelete a file it is called ```<file>.restored``` _if_ a file with the same name exists. from a usability perspective it would be better to make this restored file the newest version of the  file with the same name\r\n\r\nin other words, take the deleted file and make it the latest version. also similar to uploading a file with the same name. of course, if versions is turned off, then the existing solution would have to be the answer.\r\n\r\nand the filename should be ```<file name> (restored).<extension>```\r\ninstead of ```<file name>.<extension>.restored``` to appear less technical. for multiple restored versions/numbering, the number should be appended in the parentheses like so ```(restored 2)``` (starting with 2, because the initial one without a number is 1).\r\n\r\nconcerns: how likely is it that thereâ€™s clashes with the filename though, say the file you restore is actually a different file than the one which is in files, despite the same name? do we use some kind of id in the database to 100% identify a file independent from the name?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"schiesbn","id":1589737,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/8912b598c7b32dd25b87fd168e0b06b2?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f0a323047dbe8329db30eae8dbe96e55e.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"8912b598c7b32dd25b87fd168e0b06b2","url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn","html_url":"https://github.com/schiesbn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
