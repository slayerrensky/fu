the only custom mounts used in my scenario are local ones (mapping to the same drive - maybe they are counted twice?) and dropbox - which should only make a 2gb difference (only using the free version).\r\n\r\n2. the wording is confusing. if the second number is the free space, then the term \"of the available\" is misleading. in my opinion, as it is currently worded, the second number should indicate the _total_ space (i.e. all the space that is there for this user to store data, be it used or not), as the \"of the\" would indicate that the first number is part of what the second shows. if it is supposed to be the _still available_ (i.e. free) space, then the wording is wrong and should be rephrased - the used space is not part of the free space...\r\n\r\nmy configuration:\r\napache 2.2.22\r\nmysql 5.5.28\r\nphp 5.3.10\r\nall that running on an ubuntu server 12.04 x86_64","closed_by":{"login":"randolfcarter","id":2631274,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/e4a5d1c2c314d59e880d83b497a0d719?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f3c3d7236785996f9e5f172ea5cdac91b.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"e4a5d1c2c314d59e880d83b497a0d719","url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolfcarter","html_url":"https://github.com/randolfcarter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolfcarter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolfcarter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolfcarter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolfcarter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolfcarter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolfcarter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolfcarter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolfcarter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolfcarter/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
