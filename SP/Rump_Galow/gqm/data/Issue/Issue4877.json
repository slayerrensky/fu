/shares?file=foo&subfiles=yes will return all shares from all files in the folder specified in 'files=') \r\n  - post create new share\r\n\r\n- /share/shareid\r\n  - get get information about the specific share\r\n  - put updates the specific share\r\n  - delet delete the specific share\r\n\r\nmissing:\r\n\r\n- send mail notification to users for non-public shares, waiting for https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/4689. will implement it as optional parameter for the share operation, not sure if we need it also as separate call to trigger it after the file was share, opinions?\r\n\r\n- send public link as mail. i would like to hear some opinions, do we need this as api call for the clients or should we utilize the clients instead. especially for the mobile clients we could use local apps like email client, twitter client, sms,... to share a generated link instead of telling the owncloud server to send a mail.","closed_by":{"login":"schiesbn","id":1589737,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/8912b598c7b32dd25b87fd168e0b06b2?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f0a323047dbe8329db30eae8dbe96e55e.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"8912b598c7b32dd25b87fd168e0b06b2","url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn","html_url":"https://github.com/schiesbn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
