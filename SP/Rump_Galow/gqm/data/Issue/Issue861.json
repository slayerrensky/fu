(probably only show on hover, or permanently when the box is checked. similar to the can edit checkbox in sharing.)\r\n\r\ncc @mtrichards @karlitschek @icewind1991 ","closed_by":{"login":"jancborchardt","id":925062,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f84ec51f9ceed468217d4e13abf78da9c.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt","html_url":"https://github.com/jancborchardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
