no problem, just create the tag â»vacation yeah!â« and share it with the friends involved in it!\r\nnow no matter where you first created that tag (letâ€™s say in the files app to share a folder), it will also be available in the other apps for autocompletion.\r\n\r\nthen there would need to be a view where you can see all the items in that category, even if they are across apps (easiest way: show which other apps make use of that tag. or show images or names of task lists directly).\r\n\r\nhereâ€™s a bit more of a stretch and maybe not a good idea, but it could even be automatic â€“ wherever you create a tag, it will also be created in other apps (albeit we will probably not use the word â»tagâ« for it. maybe rather â»topicâ«):\r\n* files can have a â»bookmarkâ« type quick filter in the sidebar, like other file managers\r\n* contacts will have a group of which the contacts you shared the topic with are members of\r\n* calendar will have a calendar named by that topic, automatically shared with those people.\r\n* tasks will have a task list named by that topic, automatically shared with those people.\r\n* bookmars will have a category â€¦\r\n* pictures will have an album â€¦\r\n* news will have a folder â€¦\r\n\r\n\r\nnow i think the first step would be to get the apps which already use a notion of tags to use this. namely bookmarks @emerzh and contacts @tanghus (because contacts can be in multiple groups).\r\n\r\n\r\niâ€™m guessing @tanghus likes this (and would like to help implementing it ;)\r\ncc app devs @icewind1991 @georgehrke @emerzh @raydiation @zimba12 @bartv2\r\n\r\nwhat do you think?
