expected behaviour\r\n\r\nif you've created a ftp mount configuration the share should automatically be mounted.\r\n\r\n## actual behaviour\r\n\r\nthe configured ftp share is not being mounted if i select the share `bilderhome` from the files tab and the message \"cloud not found, i //bilderhome\" is shown instead. it might be important to mention that the mount point `bilderhome`is displayed as a file and not as a folder.\r\n\r\n## steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1) i've installed a local ftp-server and tested access to it by using a standard ftp client. the server is reachable from the local server as from the local lan and a login is also possible without any problems.\r\n\r\n2.1) at first i've created the following `mount.php` file to test access to the server:\r\n```php\r\n   <?php\r\n    return array(\r\n      'user' => array(\r\n        'jed' => array(\r\n          '/$user/files/bilderhome'=>array('class'=>'oc_filestorage_ftp','options'=>array('host'=>'ftp.privat.lan','user'=>'jed','password'=>'test','root'=>'/',' secure'=>false)),\r\n        ),\r\n      ),\r\n    );\r\n```\r\n\r\n2.2) in addition i've also tried to create the same ftp mount using the gui to access the server. as a result the following `mount.json` file was created:\r\n```php\r\n{\"user\":{\"jed\":{\"\\/$user\\/files\\/bilderhome\":{\"class\":\"\\\\oc\\\\files\\\\storage\\\\ftp\",\"options\":{\"host\":\"ftp.privat.lan\",\"user\":\"jed\",\"password\":\"test\",\"root\":\"\",\"secure\":\"false\"}}}}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3) if i select the displayed share `bilderhome`, which is not displayed as folder but as a file, the message \"cloud not found, i //bilderhome\" is displayed.\r\n\r\n4) if i select the administrator menu, the following php error is shown on the screen for a short moment:\r\n```php\r\n    `warning: stat():  stat failed for ftp://jed:test@ftp.privat.lan/ in .../owncloud/apps/files_external/lib/streamwrapper.php on line 81`\r\n```\r\n\r\n## environment\r\n\r\n#### server configuration\r\n\r\nos: linux 2.6.24-24\r\nweb server: apache/ 2.2.22\r\ndatabase:
