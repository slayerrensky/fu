once merged we can check the item on the todo list.\r\n\r\n**how to implement a public api?**\r\n1. create an interface in the public namespace within lib/public which acts as the entry point for accessing the functionality e.g. https://github.com/owncloud/core/blob/5d4e9e0d25831cbe1b9c2fef52016c6ed1bbcb55/lib/public/ipreview.php#l14\r\n\r\n2. add a getter to the iservercontainer - e.g. https://github.com/owncloud/core/blob/5d4e9e0d25831cbe1b9c2fef52016c6ed1bbcb55/lib/public/iservercontainer.php#l56\r\n\r\n3. implement the api within the **private** namespace e.g. https://github.com/owncloud/core/blob/5d4e9e0d25831cbe1b9c2fef52016c6ed1bbcb55/lib/previewmanager.php\r\n\r\n4. add the implementation of the getter to \\oc\\server - please use the provided methods registerservice() and query() because with this approach only those classes will be created which are going to be used \r\nhttps://github.com/owncloud/core/blob/5d4e9e0d25831cbe1b9c2fef52016c6ed1bbcb55/lib/server.php#l88\r\nhttps://github.com/owncloud/core/blob/5d4e9e0d25831cbe1b9c2fef52016c6ed1bbcb55/lib/server.php#l49\r\n\r\n**mainly important on all public classes, interfaces and methods: add proper phpdoc comments**\r\n\r\n**missing apis**\r\n- [x] file api - fixed with https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/4712\r\n- [x] avatar #5040\r\n- [x] config - #4928\r\n- [ ] search\r\n- [ ] ocp\\app with getappwebpath() & loadapps() - #4919\r\n- [ ] oc_fileproxy - see below\r\n- [x] oc_cache - #4886 \r\n- [x] oc_appconfig - is done with the config interface\r\n- [ ] oc::getversionstring() - maybe define an interface iutil?\r\n- [ ] oc_app::disable() oc_app::enable() - coming in #5069\r\n- [x] session (and kill session from irequest) - #4888\r\n- [ ] user and group managers\r\n- [ ] ocs api\r\n- [x] template and related functions like nav menu - nav part in #4928\r\n- [x] response sub classes\r\n- [x] appframework -
