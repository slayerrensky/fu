the apps management uses the left side for listing apps and the right big content area for the app details. this is suboptimal for various reasons, including the initial empty space on the right, the lack of quick filtering, no scaling when many apps are in there, and the long clickery needed to just enable/disable an app.\r\n\r\nletâ€™s redesign it simple. basically the left list is used for grouping, and the right content area is used to show a list of apps, nice big entries with a logo or screenshot, short description preview (expandable on click) and enable/disable button right there.\r\n\r\n## left list\r\n\r\nwould be a filter for the apps shown on the right. by default, installed is selected.\r\n\r\n* installed\r\n* recommended (great outstanding apps, picked from core & community)\r\n\r\npreviously i also thought about 2 entries for â»coreâ« and â»communityâ«, but i think that distinction is not necessary â€“ rather we solve this through the inherently shipped apps and the recommended ones.\r\n\r\nthen below that we could have a list of categories, which also includes apps from core & community (this are the categories from the chrome webstore):\r\n* business tools\r\n* education\r\n* entertainment\r\n* games\r\n* lifestyle\r\n* news\r\n* productivity\r\n* social & communication\r\n* utilities\r\n\r\nthe app manifest should probably have an entry for â»categoryâ«, and enable multiple categories maybe.\r\n\r\n\r\n## right content\r\n\r\nby default this will show the list of installed apps. entries should be big (~100px high), with a screenshot or logo to the left, the app title, first 2â€“3 lines of description (expandable on click), and the enable button to the right of each entry.\r\n\r\nin each group the sorting is recommended ones first, and then everything else, alphabetically (for now, until we can get ratings or such).\r\n\r\nthere is no extra detail page for an app, at least for now. as itâ€™s only visible for admins anyway we donâ€™t need to go too overboard with the design and snazzyness in this iteration.\r\n\r\n\r\nfeedback for these early thoughts @raydiation @karlitschek @deepdiver1975?","closed_by":null}
