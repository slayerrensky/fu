maybe even automatically connect. because there is the possibility that the app is shut down, on erroneous connection it should fall back to expose the input fields of course. what do you think?\r\n\r\nthe google drive connection i didnâ€™t even manage, because searching for client id and client secret and google drive yielded no results. how can i do it?","closed_by":{"login":"mtgap","id":1097106,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/454a73ee5feeb428d0c163a48903332c?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f52d29a66f285a1d61125dd69ac0766b2.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"454a73ee5feeb428d0c163a48903332c","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap","html_url":"https://github.com/mtgap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
