expected behaviour\r\nlogin succeeds even if userid and login name are different\r\n\r\n### actual behaviour\r\nthe user backend is determined on basis of a pre-login user exists where the loginname is passed instead of the userid. the userid is returned by the user backend only by checkpassword.\r\n\r\n### steps to reproduce\r\nscenario a)\r\n1. configure ldap backend while leaving expert options as default\r\n2. attempt to login with an ldap user.\r\n\r\n~~scenario b)\r\n1. attempt to login with a local user, but with a different case (e.g. alice instead of alice). it worked before, too, especially tablet user benefit when the first letter is uppercase automatically.~~\r\n\r\nthe misbehaviour is caused by https://github.com/owncloud/core/blob/master/lib/user/session.php#l124 where login name is passed instead of uid. also checkpassword returns (at least that was the case up until oc 5) the userid, but it is not being respected here
