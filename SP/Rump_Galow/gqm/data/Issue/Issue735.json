(but i didn't find it?)\n\nthe \"problem\" is this: i have a lot of folders and files in my oc. if someone of my buddies needs a file (from somewhere inside of my folder infrastructure), i share this file/ folder via link, post my friend the link and close my oc...\n\nso, after a day or two my buddy downloaded the file and the share can be removed. so, sometimes i forget, which files/ folders i shared and then i have to go into every single folder and have to mouseover every single file/ folder to see the currently shared files/ folders...\n\nmy amateurish solution for this prob, is to make a text-file were i put a list in. it looks like this:\n\n- foldera/folderxy/file1\n- folderz/folderx/folderf/file99\n- foldergg/filexy\n- folder99/folder1\n- and so on...\n\nas you can see, in this list i note every shared file/ folder, to have an overview, which files/ folders currently are shared...\n\n\ni wish, oc has an inbuild feature, which shows every single currently shared file/ folder and where i can quickly de-share them...\n\n(sorry if there is already a solution present to my problem, but i didn't find it till now...)","closed_by":{"login":"jancborchardt","id":925062,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f84ec51f9ceed468217d4e13abf78da9c.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt","html_url":"https://github.com/jancborchardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
