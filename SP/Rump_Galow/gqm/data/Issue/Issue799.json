(maybe with an warning about ascii characters.) it can be a little annoying to create groups and assign users to them only to see all the work done vanish after a page refresh.\n\n#5 comment posted by mtrichards oct 22, 18:22\nagreed - if it is not allowed, it should not be allowed to be created...\n","closed_by":{"login":"bartv2","id":2227877,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/c2d86a0a66a4be2c904e24034e842f44?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f05e8b1362feb118a386dfd282b20fb84.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"c2d86a0a66a4be2c904e24034e842f44","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartv2","html_url":"https://github.com/bartv2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartv2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartv2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartv2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartv2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartv2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartv2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartv2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartv2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartv2/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
