filename=\"test.txt\"');\r\nheader('content-type: text/plain');\r\necho(\"this is the test text content\\n\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. put that php on some server\r\n3. in owncloudnew->from url choose the url for the php created in step 1 (i.e. http://example.com/dl.php)\r\n4. after upload has finished, in the file view, you will see a new file called \"dl.php\"\r\n\r\n### server configuration\r\noperating system: ubuntu server 12.04 lts 64 bit\r\nweb server: apache 2.2.22\r\ndatabase: mysql ver 14.14 distrib 5.5.28\r\nphp version: 5.3.10\r\nowncloud version: 4.5.5\r\n\r\n### client configuration\r\nbrowser: firefox 18.0\r\noperating system: windows 7","closed_by":null}
