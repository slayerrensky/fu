talked with @schiesbn about some fixes for the versions dropdown. writing it down here for the record:\r\n\r\n* versions should be displayed directly in the dropdown, and not in a dropdown in the dropdown (currently itâ€™s very unclear what happens if you select something from the dropdown)\r\n* entries should be labeled â»1 hour agoâ«, â»15 days agoâ« etc, exposing the actual date on hover (just like modified date) â€“ if there are multiple entries for say â»10 days agoâ«, the time of day should be appended like â»10 days ago, 13:00â«\r\n* next to every entry should be a â»restoreâ« button to clearly label what happens (maybe only show on hover to not clutter everything)\r\n* only the last 5 versions will be shown\r\n* if there are more versions, there will be a button â»more versions â€¦â« on the bottom, which will load 5 more versions, and so on (versions get less and less going deeper into the past so there will probably be no issue with the length of the list here)\r\n\r\nthis will also remove the need for an extra screen for â»all versionsâ« which rips people out of the files app.\r\n\r\ndoes that sound good @mtrichards? any other requirements?","closed_by":{"login":"schiesbn","id":1589737,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/8912b598c7b32dd25b87fd168e0b06b2?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f0a323047dbe8329db30eae8dbe96e55e.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"8912b598c7b32dd25b87fd168e0b06b2","url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn","html_url":"https://github.com/schiesbn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
