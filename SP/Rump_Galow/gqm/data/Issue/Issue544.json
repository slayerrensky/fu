was looking at bugs https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/543 and https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/325 with klaas and found following with most recent stable45 and a fresh and clean user:\n\nafter first login and running the filescan, we have of coure an empty file system. thus, the file cache table for this user looks like:\n\n```\nselect id,path,parent,name,size,mimetype,mimepart,writable from oc_fscache  where  user = 'leon';\n+-----+-------------+--------+-------+------+----------------------+----------+----------+\n| id  | path        | parent | name  | size | mimetype             | mimepart | writable |\n+-----+-------------+--------+-------+------+----------------------+----------+----------+\n| 193 | /leon/files |     -1 | files |    0 | httpd/unix-directory | httpd    |        1 |\n+-----+-------------+--------+-------+------+----------------------+----------+----------+\n```\n\nthen i create a new folder. in the file cache table it will appear, but with -1 as parent instead of 193.  plus, the home folder is doubled:\n\n```\nselect id,path,parent,name,size,mimetype,mimepart,writable from oc_fscache  where  user = 'leon';\n+-----+-------------------+--------+-------+------+----------------------+----------+----------+\n| id  | path              | parent | name  | size | mimetype             | mimepart | writable |\n+-----+-------------------+--------+-------+------+----------------------+----------+----------+\n| 193 | /leon/files       |     -1 | files |    0 | httpd/unix-directory | httpd    |        1 |\n| 194 | /leon/files       |     -1 | files |    0 | httpd/unix-directory | httpd    |        1 |\n| 195 | /leon/files/leaks |     -1 | leaks |    0 | httpd/unix-directory | httpd    |        1 |\n+-----+-------------------+--------+-------+------+----------------------+----------+----------+\n```\n\n→ on a refresh of \"files\", it appears empty.\n\n→this also happens for existing user accounts.\n\n→ i believe it clings together with the bug reports referenced to in the beginning.","closed_by":{"login":"blizzz","id":2184312,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/1898b25a9cb3aa1a0f0febd1359910b9?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2fca03acec6deadf508b75eb0cf9ba036c.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"1898b25a9cb3aa1a0f0febd1359910b9","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz","html_url":"https://github.com/blizzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
