[name]. \r\n\r\nafter i have replaced the references to basename() function to my custom basename_safe() one in /lib/base.php, owncloud has started working without a hitch:\r\n\r\nfunction basename_safe($path, $suffix=null) {\r\n    $path = rtrim($path,'/');\r\n    $path = explode('/',$path);\r\n    return end($path);\r\n}\r\n\r\nby the way, sabre made a design choice not to use standard basename(), it has it's own solution for basename(): sabre_dav_urlutil->splitpath().\r\n\r\nis it possible to have a configuration variable, which would switch to alternative basename() implementation for the purpose of running owncloud on embedded systems?\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"raydiation","id":195053,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/aa0d7b7302e0d7f4f9513c23b571383a?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2faf0a25e27510f77d97634a6bbe653b13.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"aa0d7b7302e0d7f4f9513c23b571383a","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation","html_url":"https://github.com/raydiation","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
