working with big file chunking which works nice so far :+1:  there is one problem that should be fixed: the upload of the last chunk takes long, way longer than all the other uploads. this is because the resulting file is assembled in that step which takes long long for big files. maybe its also because of versioning?!\r\n\r\nthat is not only a cosmetic thing but since we can easily run into timeouts with larger files which causes big inconvenience for the user: the long upload has finished, but while assembling the server times out. exactly to avoid that was one of the initial ideas of big file chunking.\r\n\r\ntested with stable5 branch.","closed_by":{"login":"jancborchardt","id":925062,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f84ec51f9ceed468217d4e13abf78da9c.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt","html_url":"https://github.com/jancborchardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
