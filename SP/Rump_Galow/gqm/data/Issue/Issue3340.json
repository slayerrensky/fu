discussing this in thorough detail with @jancborchardt and @raydiation past weekend, here is how we will be handling the files app in owncloud 6.\r\na left sidebar and right content distinction, it is to make the style completely uniform between applications. the right content will mostly be the files list. \r\n<h4>left sidebar:</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>all files</li>\r\n<li>shared with you</li>\r\n<li>shared by you</li>\r\n<li>deleted files</li>\r\n<li>external storage (which currently is displayed in the files list itself) </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>right content:</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>the file name should be the only one opening the file, the rest of the space should be for marking, making it easier to select multiple files.</li>\r\n<li>fileactions to be moved to more relevant position.**</li>\r\n<li>thumbnails for the files.</li>\r\n<li>images of users, if present, to be displayed along with the share icon in fileactions, basically to display with whom the files have been shared.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<i>**fileactions positioning:</i>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>rename to be moved directly next to the file name.</li>\r\n<li>history to be moved next to the modified date, making that whole cell clickable to reveal the versions drop-down.</li>\r\n<li>download to be moved next to the file size, just like history only being an icon but making the whole cell clickable to download the file.</li>\r\n<li>splitting the drop-downs for version and sharing.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nhere is a mockup i prepared about how it should look like : \r\n![gsoc-files-app](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/992488/499853/354638a2-bc5e-11e2-9f48-872fa968798d.png)\r\n\r\nnote that this is just a sketch to give an idea and more clearer picture will be visible when we start developing it.\r\ni also plan to write some acceptance tests for it, to ensure it is rock solid. (cc @raydiation )\r\n\r\nthis issue is a sum of : #1936 #3090 #2424 #202 and some more. :)\r\nany further suggestions are most welcome!\r\n\r\n","closed_by":null}
