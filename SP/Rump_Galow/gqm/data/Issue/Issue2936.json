everyone,\r\n\r\nmy owncloud is installed on a 10go disk. i have 12 users with no storage limit. i have 1go of files shared with all the users.\r\n\r\nwhen i delete file, i expect it to go to the trash. and my files actually go to the trash but are deleted straight away because the program consider that the trash is \"full\".\r\n\r\nindeed, when i want to delete a file, the available space in the trash is calculated with this formula:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$quota = \\oc\\files\\filesystem::free_space('/') / count(\\ocp\\user::getusers());\r\n$rootinfo = $view->getfileinfo('/files');\r\n$free = $quota-$rootinfo['size'];\r\n```\r\n(the file concerned is /apps/files_trashbin/lib/trash.php lines 109 to 129)\r\n\r\nin my case, we have:\r\n```php\r\n$quota = 10 go / 12 = 0.8 go\r\n$rootinfo['size'] = 1go\r\n$free = -200mo\r\n```\r\n$free being < 0, my trash is considered full and instantly emptied.\r\n\r\ni decided to delete the \" / count(\\ocp\\user::getusers());\".\r\nanother solution would be that one:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$quota = \\oc\\files\\filesystem::free_space('/');\r\n$rootinfo = $view->getfileinfo('/files');\r\n$free = ($quota-$rootinfo['size']) / count(\\ocp\\user::getusers());\r\n```\r\n\r\ni don't know the best solution and i'm quite a newbie so i leave that up to you guys, but i think this is a quite important problem that should be solved quite quickly.\r\n\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\n(sorry, i'm a github newbie so i don't know if i reported this issue well)","closed_by":{"login":"schiesbn","id":1589737,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/8912b598c7b32dd25b87fd168e0b06b2?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f0a323047dbe8329db30eae8dbe96e55e.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"8912b598c7b32dd25b87fd168e0b06b2","url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn","html_url":"https://github.com/schiesbn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
