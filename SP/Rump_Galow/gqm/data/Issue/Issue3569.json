(from swap i would guess) i thought it abnormal and i had a few videos which were a little large i thought might be causing problems (though they had been there for a while without much issue) when i tried to log into the web interface i was greeted with a completely blank screen - no error, nothing in view source either. \r\n\r\ni tried upgrading packages changing to the newest owncloud version, restarting apache and mysql services, still same issue. \r\n\r\nserver is ubuntu server 11.10\r\n\r\ni see this a few times in the apache log:\r\n\r\n[sun may 19 22:13:12 2013] [error] [client 69.142.90.54] php warning:  include(): filename cannot be empty in /home/jms/owncloud/lib/template.php on line 408\r\n[sun may 19 22:13:12 2013] [error] [client 69.142.90.54] php warning:  include(): failed opening '' for inclusion (include_path='/home/jms/owncloud/lib:/home/jms/owncloud/config:/home/jms/owncloud/3rdparty:/home/jms/owncloud/apps:/home/jms/owncloud/lib:.:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/pear:/home/jms/owncloud') in /home/jms/owncloud/lib/template.php on line 408\r\n\r\nand these errors in the owncloud log:\r\n\r\n{\"app\":\"php\",\"message\":\"include(): filename cannot be empty at \\/home\\/jms\\/owncloud\\/lib\\/template.php#441\",\"level\":2,\"time\":1369107865}\r\n{\"app\":\"php\",\"message\":\"include(): failed opening '' for inclusion (include_path='\\/home\\/jms\\/owncloud\\/lib:\\/home\\/jms\\/owncloud\\/config:\\/home\\/$\r\n{\"app\":\"php\",\"message\":\"include(): filename cannot be empty at \\/home\\/jms\\/owncloud\\/lib\\/template.php#441\",\"level\":2,\"time\":1369107875}\r\n{\"app\":\"php\",\"message\":\"include(): failed opening '' for inclusion (include_path='\\/home\\/jms\\/owncloud\\/lib:\\/home\\/jms\\/owncloud\\/config:\\/home\\/$\r\n{\"app\":\"php\",\"message\":\"include(): filename cannot be empty at \\/home\\/jms\\/owncloud\\/lib\\/template.php#441\",\"level\":2,\"time\":1369202278}\r\n{\"app\":\"php\",\"message\":\"include(): failed opening '' for inclusion (include_path='\\/home\\/jms\\/owncloud\\/lib:\\/home\\/jms\\/owncloud\\/config:\\/home\\/$\r\n{\"app\":\"php\",\"message\":\"include(): filename cannot be empty at \\/home\\/jms\\/owncloud\\/lib\\/template.php#441\",\"level\":2,\"time\":1369271931}\r\n{\"app\":\"php\",\"message\":\"include(): failed opening '' for inclusion (include_path='\\/home\\/jms\\/owncloud\\/lib:\\/home\\/jms\\/owncloud\\/config:\\/home\\/$","closed_by":{"login":"karlitschek","id":867445,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/87ce2b4531ee1a0c32b50e0d8f049224?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f06e7098636caebfc9c30c9f52eb905df.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"87ce2b4531ee1a0c32b50e0d8f049224","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek","html_url":"https://github.com/karlitschek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
