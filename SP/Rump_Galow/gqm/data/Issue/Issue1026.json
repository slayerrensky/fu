like to use the \"new from url\" function to download youtube videos to my owncloud 4.5.5 instance. the problem is that it doesn't work with the kind of long urls with parameters one needs to download the videos, either because the url is too long or owncloud has trouble handling the parameters.\r\n\r\nexample: using the firefox addon \"download youtube videos as mp4 and flv \" , a video about owncloud (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyyzkete3ja) results in the following download url which works fine in firefox but fails when trying to get owncloud to download it.\r\n\r\nit seems to me the problem is that the filename owncloud is trying to store the downloaded url as is invalid because it's an url with special characters. it might also be it is because the url is very long or maybe even because the parameters. i can't say for sure.\r\n\r\nvideo download
