there,\r\ni'm experiencing trouble installing owncloud v5.0.0beta2 during which i receive the following output from owncloud:\r\n\r\n![screenshot240](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1715252/195059/67e2b47e-7fd3-11e2-99a7-d25c5e6639f6.png)\r\n\r\n>your web server is not yet properly setup to allow files synchronization because the webdav interface seems to be broken.\r\n\r\nthis error occurs immediately after entering credentials for the initial setup. when i then try to login to the owncloud installation, the login attempt fails with:\r\n> lost your password?\r\n\r\ni have tried the installation multiple times without success. based on the logs, i believe the issue is related to my ssl certificate and curl. it appears curl isn't seeing a valid ca for my cert (comodo positivessl). i'm assuming sabredav is attempting to confirm that it is operational (and failing) and is subsequently causing the entire installation process to fail.\r\n\r\ni can confirm that my ssl certificate is valid as it works properly for all other uses on this server. i'm hoping this is as easy to fix as adding the proper ca for my certificate so that curl knows to trust it. if this is the case, where do i need to put the ca for this to work properly? is curl using a default set of ca certs or is it using any at all?\r\n\r\ni would imagine others installing in an ssl environment would encounter this issue as well if this is related to untrusted cas, especially considering many people will be using self-signed certificates.\r\n\r\nmy reporting template is below. thanks for helping.\r\n\r\n### expected behaviour\r\nowncloud installs properly\r\n\r\n### actual behaviour\r\nowncloud fails to install with:\r\n>your web server is not yet properly setup to allow files synchronization because the webdav interface seems to be broken.\r\n\r\n### steps to reproduce\r\n1. configure working ssl-only apache2 webserver with ssl certificate from positivessl\r\n2. add owncloud directory configuration to apache2\r\n3. install owncloud\r\n4. attempt to complete the installation via the web
