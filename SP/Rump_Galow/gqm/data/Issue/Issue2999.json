expected behaviour\r\nwhen renaming a file via webgui, simply rename on the client side\r\n\r\n### actual behaviour\r\nrenaming a file via webgui triggers the download of the entire file causing a possible high and unwanted traffic. on the client (winxp, see detail later) it will displays also a pop-up on the try icon saying that the old file(name) was removed!\r\ntested with a 900mb file and a few mb file\r\n\r\n### steps to reproduce\r\n1. synchronize a file to the cloud\r\n2. rename it\r\n3. on the client side the file will be redowloaded\r\n\r\n### server configuration\r\noperating system:\r\nrhel6.3 x86_64 (scientific linux release 6.3 (carbon))\r\n\r\nweb server: \r\napache (httpd-2.2.15-26.sl6.x86_64)\r\n\r\ndatabase:\r\nmysql-server-5.1.67-1.el6_3.x86_64\r\n\r\nphp version:\r\nphp-5.3.3-22.el6.x86_64\r\n\r\nowncloud version:\r\nowncloud-3rdparty-5.0.4-18.1.noarch\r\nowncloud-5.0.4-18.1.noarch\r\n\r\n\r\n### client configuration\r\nbrowser:\r\nfirefox 18.0.1\r\n\r\nowncloud client 1.2.4\r\n\r\noperating system:\r\nwinxp 64\r\n\r\n### logs\r\napparently nothing strange\r\n\r\n### other comments and details\r\nwhen an object will be renamed and re-transferred, it's old reference, will be put in the trash causing a double space occupancy (from the file-system point of view) till the user delete explicitly them from the trash.\r\nthe problem is more critical when we rename a directory (via webgui or client): all it's content will be re-transferred and the old references (and all the space allocated) will be moved to the trash.","closed_by":{"login":"jancborchardt","id":925062,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f84ec51f9ceed468217d4e13abf78da9c.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt","html_url":"https://github.com/jancborchardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
