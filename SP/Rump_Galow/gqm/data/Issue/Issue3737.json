implements swift pseudo subfolder structure a little differently than cyberduck.\r\n\r\nfor example, in owncloud, if i create a subfolder called folder1, it creates a whole new container.\r\n\r\nroot_container\\folder1\r\n\r\nin cyberduck, if i create a subfolder, it creates a plain file called \"folder1\" of type \"application/directory\"\r\n\r\nfolder1\r\nfolder1/kalimba.mp3\r\n\r\nalso, the folder delimiter is different in cyberduck \"/\" instead of \"\\\".\r\n\r\nso, subfolders created in cyberduck are not displayed in owncloud and vice-versa. is there a way to change the implementation so that the folders can be accessed both from cyberduck and owncloud? it seems cyberduck is implementing this correctly because a subfolder should not be a whole new
