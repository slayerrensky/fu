prerequisite\r\ni managed to get the shared folder to sync with my desktop client by changing the syncing remote path to / instead of /clientsync, so that my owncloud folder will look exactly the same as shown on the browser.\r\n\r\n### expected behaviour\r\nwhen the owner update content of shared folder from his computer, it will sync with the server and the person he shared with, his client will sync as well if he has done the prerequisite stated above.\r\n\r\n### actual behaviour\r\nthe clientsync of the person being shared to does not get triggered to update unless the updated file get renamed. whereas if the person being shared to changes the file content of the shared folder, the owner's clientsync does sync properly.\r\n\r\n### steps to reproduce (method 1)\r\n1. user a share folder a with user b.\r\n2. user a updates file a in folder a on the computer without renaming.\r\n3. client sync got triggered.\r\n4. server side files get updated.\r\n5. user b can see the updated file a in the browser.\r\n6. user b client sync does not change the file a to the updated version on the computer.\r\n7. user a rename file a.\r\n8. client sync got triggered.\r\n9. server side files get updated.\r\n10. user b can see the renamed file a in the browser.\r\n11. user b client sync works as per normal and the renamed file a is updated on the computer.\r\n\r\n### steps to reproduce (method 2)\r\n1. user a share folder a with user b.\r\n2. user a copies a file file b to folder a on computer. \r\n3. client sync got triggered.\r\n4. server side files get updated.\r\n5. user b can see the file b in the browser.\r\n6. user b client sync does not add file b on the computer.\r\n7. user a rename file b.\r\n8. client sync got triggered.\r\n9. server side files get updated.\r\n10. user b can see the renamed file b in the browser.\r\n11. user b client sync works as per normal and the renamed file b will appear on the computer.\r\n\r\nnote: if user b updates files or add new files to folder a. user a will receive everything synced perfectly on the computer.\r\n\r\n### server configuration\r\noperating system: windows server 2008 r2 std\r\n\r\nweb server: iis
