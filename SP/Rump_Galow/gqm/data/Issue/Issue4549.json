(this is the first time the user database is up to get populated with ldap entries - this is no refresh or \"update\" of new users!! it had been a fresh oc >5.0.9 installation!)\r\n\r\nwhen i then switch to the user site und look at the imported entries, you can watch the following:\r\n\r\n1) the page is just filled with 30 names from the active directory plus the build in admin account. but the active directory tree which was set up in the configuration, consists of more than a hundred user entries!! (even after a reinstall of the database server and starting with a clean install leads to exaclty the same behaviour)\r\n\r\n2) the entries are mostly not users - even contacts (which actually are not able to have a password or crendentials to login) are imported for any reason\r\n\r\n3) some entries just don't have any displayname but \"false\". i can guarantee, that no displayname in any kind of object got this name!
