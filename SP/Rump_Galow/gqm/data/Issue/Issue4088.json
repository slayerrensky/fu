some reason non of the data is pulled (user or group mappings) and many of the check box attributes (like tls on or off) can not be set in the ui, you need to go into the database and set them directly.\r\n\r\nonce i have done that, the test connection succeeds however, no data is pulled from the ad server and authentication does not work.\r\n\r\nin the oc logs i see the
