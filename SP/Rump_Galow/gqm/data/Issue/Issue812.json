http://bugs.owncloud.org/thebuggenie/owncloud/issues/oc-833\n\nthe behaviour with v4.5.4 is still as described in the report. please determine what the appropriate action is.\n\ndescription:\ni have owncloud installed in http://localhost/owncloud, and the files are not under document root (but installed in /usr/local/share/owncloud). the mod_rewrite caldav/carddav redirects created in the .htaccess file lack the rewrite base directive required for relative path redirects (see http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_rewrite.html). modifying the .htaccess file with the following fixes the problem:\n\nrewrite base /owncloud/ rewrite rule ^apps/calendar/caldav.php(.*) remote.php/caldav$1 qsa,r rewrite rule ^apps/contacts/carddav.php(.*) remote.php/carddav$1 qsa,r\n\nsetup.php should automatically detect non-toplevel installs and create the correct .htaccess file.\n\n(note, the rewrite rule entries need a 'r' not 'l' redirects, as the internal redirects don't appear to work correctly with remote.php).\n\nreproduction steps:\n\n    install owncloud someplace that's not under document root (eg /usr/local/share/owncloud)\n    create an alias from /owncloud to the install directory (alias /owncloud /usr/local/share/owncloud)\n    add \"allowoverride options file info\" in directory directive for /usr/local/share/owncloud\n    run setup\n    note that created .htaccess file lacks rewrite base\n    navigate to http://localhost/owncloud/apps/calendar/caldav.php/calendars/\n    receive 404 not found\n    add rewrite base /owncloud/\n    navigate to url again\n    receive the error \"no input file specified\"\n    modify the rewrite rules replacing l redirects with r.\n    navigate to url again\n    receive correct calendar listing.\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"karlitschek","id":867445,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/87ce2b4531ee1a0c32b50e0d8f049224?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f06e7098636caebfc9c30c9f52eb905df.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"87ce2b4531ee1a0c32b50e0d8f049224","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek","html_url":"https://github.com/karlitschek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
