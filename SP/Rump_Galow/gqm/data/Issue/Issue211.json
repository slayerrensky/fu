seems to be there is some problem between syncing ldap objects and the mysql database backend.\r\n\r\ni'll appreciate any help on this, as this is the final hurdle before being able to deploy this in my organization.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nenvironment: windows server 2008 r2\r\nweb server: iis 7.5\r\nphp: 5.3.18\r\nmysql: 5.5.28\r\nowncloud: 4.5.1","closed_by":{"login":"blizzz","id":2184312,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/1898b25a9cb3aa1a0f0febd1359910b9?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2fca03acec6deadf508b75eb0cf9ba036c.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"1898b25a9cb3aa1a0f0febd1359910b9","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz","html_url":"https://github.com/blizzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false}}
