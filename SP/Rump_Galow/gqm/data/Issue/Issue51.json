you upload a file and select to overwrite the existing file, it does not create a new version immediately, but creates temporarily for the undo functionality a file (2). if you wait for a while until you reload the page, that file is being synced to the desktop or displayed in the webfrontend or mobile app. then, after you reload the page, this change is being reverted and a newer version of the original file is being created. \r\nthis is confusing. \r\ni propose to change this to the immediate creation of a new version with a notice in the yellow pop-up at the top of the screen telling the user that a new version was created.\r\n\r\nreproduction:\r\n1. create a file (e.g. hello) with the webfrontend\r\n2. on the local desktop create a file with the same name but different content\r\n3.
