expected behaviour\r\nfiles containing a colon in their file name uploaded via webdav should be accessible. invalid characters should be removed or replaced when uploading.\r\n\r\n### actual behaviour\r\nafter uploading the file it is not possible to access the file anymore. after renaming the file, i.e. removing the colon, the file can be accessed as well.\r\n\r\n### steps to reproduce\r\n1. upload any file which contains a colon\r\n2. try to access the file via web interface\r\n\r\n### server configuration\r\noperating system: ubuntu 12.04.2 lts\r\nweb server: apache
