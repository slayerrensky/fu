these days i have no time to work on this, but i want to say i very much appreciate your hard work on oc. thank you.\r\nalso i understand the problem that make you store passwords in a file in clear text.. cups does the same when authentication has to be done via samba. the difference is that in cups that file has mode 640 while mount.json is still 644.. of course when i was testing oc i set myself the mode to 640 to the mount.json files.. as i understand it, the point is that you (oc developers) believe you have corrected the file mode to 640 (as i read up on this thread), but that is not true.. (at least not at the time i was testing oc) each time oc creates (or updates?) a new mount.json file, it has mode 644.. that is the thing that should be fixed immediately as it should take only a few minutes and it already adds some security, vs the zero security it has now.\r\nin any case, if not already fixed, when the project that brought me working on oc will be restarted, i will try a pull, fix and push.\r\nbest regards."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/21358922","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/2718#issuecomment-21358922","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/2718","id":21358922,"user":{"login":"aclater","id":105859,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/8574aa3d5147f1a8cdb476fd903ab769?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f685f2f14ce1b9a8ee6f300dc7d902ac3.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"8574aa3d5147f1a8cdb476fd903ab769","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclater","html_url":"https://github.com/aclater","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclater/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclater/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclater/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclater/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclater/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclater/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclater/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclater/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclater/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-07-22t17:00:20z","updated_at":"2013-07-22t17:00:20z","body":"agreed - at a minimum you are still writing the file 644\r\n\r\ndrwxr-xr-x. 5 apache apache    88 jul 20 17:25 .\r\ndrwxrwx---. 6 apache apache  4096 jul 20 17:05 ..\r\ndrwxr-xr-x. 2 apache apache     6 jul 20 16:55 cache\r\ndrwxr-xr-x. 2 apache apache 16384 jul 20 17:16 files\r\ndrwxr-xr-x. 3 apache apache    28 jul 20 17:17 files_external\r\n-rw-r--r--. 1 apache apache   423 jul 20 17:24 mount.json\r\n"}]
