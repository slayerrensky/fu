than this, for an extreme case more apps. can be added to display an entire page of apps enabled.\r\n\r\nto save a bit more space, you can consider showing the name besides the user image the way it

please remember to evaluate your thoughts on a range of devices (and range of user skill levels).\r\n- personally i prefer apps on the left *on my laptop*, because it's a very letterbox shaped screen\r\n- personally i prefer tabs on the top of the screen on the ipad because i hold it in letter format and scroll. also witness that this is a common layout for many modern, high profile websites, ie tabs at the top (scroll to the top of this page to see that...)\r\n- personally i think that a phone screen is tiny for web pages and hence needs some special thought and compromise or you need to zoom and pinch and drag and ...  so, here some kind of hidden until needed seems sensible\r\n- basically there doesn't seem to be one perfect option, hence consider something dynamic on screen size\r\n- (also name one other high profile website where the \"tabs\" are on the left rather than the top... consistency...)\r\n\r\nwith regards to drop down apps list.  personally i think that only the geeky 50% of users will ever find this button.  assuming that the target market is a broad range of users, and the site is viewed as a \"web page\", rather than an application, then most users (not you and i) will struggle to \r\n- find anything which won't fit on a 1280x800 screen and needs to be scrolled to\r\n- find anything which drops down or needs clicking on a link smaller than a thumbnail icon\r\n- find major interface cues that are more complex than: a simple list which can be scanned in the classic f shaped scan\r\n\r\nnow, don't get me wrong, for *me* you could load the interface up with clever drop down clickables and my laptop is set to autohide the dock, etc - *i* like a power user interface.  however, i have to respect that every day i take tech support calls from our users in $job where it takes an average of 1-2 minutes to guide them through opening up our website and *scrolling* slightly down to click a link just off the visible area... real users absolutely struggle to hit dropdown menus accurately and i would say only 70% success rate to hit the drop down item first time...\r\n\r\nso, please try to think outside of just the geeks (like us) who are skilled users with a mouse and have the energy to \"work out\" a new interface.  the average user needs the interface to have some similarity to other common websites that they use daily (which increasingly means tabs at the top, navigation down the left/right, some use of single row dropdowns ok, but try to avoid)\r\n\r\ncheers"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/14168370","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/1932#issuecomment-14168370","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/1932","id":14168370,"user":{"login":"jancborchardt","id":925062,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f84ec51f9ceed468217d4e13abf78da9c.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt","html_url":"https://github.com/jancborchardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-02-27t11:06:31z","updated_at":"2013-02-27t11:06:31z","body":"before
