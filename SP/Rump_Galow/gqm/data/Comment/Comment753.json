don't know myself, but let's try to she some light here on unicode-compat in general:\r\n\r\n- linux: all linux distributions i am aware of use utf-8 these days\r\n- mac os x: utf-8, no exceptions (mind the different unicode normalization, though).\r\n- windows: utf-16. but then again, there is also no smbclient on windows.\r\n\r\nso i think utf-8 is safe. what is not necessarily safe is assuming en_us:\r\n\r\neven with unicode, the country is still important to indicate collation (sorting) [1], which is of particular relevance with data bases and files. if we just query files and sort them in the web interface/webdav client, i do not think that this is a problem, but be aware that, again depending on the locale and its collation, strings can be considered equal that do not
