idea. i think this can be integrated nicely in the new versions drop-down i'm working on. but i'm not sure if we should show a preview or simply download the file which allows you to view it with your favourite desktop viewer. the reason: a preview works nicely for pictures or for the video player where we display a \"overlay\". but other viewers like the text editor or the pdf viewer open in full screen mode which would result in a bad user experience. what do you think
