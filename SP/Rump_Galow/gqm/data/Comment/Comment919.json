is decidedly still an issue, seen on oc 5.0.10.\r\n\r\n### expected behaviour\r\ndrive space usage should show actual information from owncloud.\r\n\r\n### actual behaviour\r\ndrive space usage mirrors system drive usage, gives out of space errors when you exceed the available space on your local system drive.  if drive c: is 60 gb, then the mapped owncloud drive will show as 60 gb.   if 58 gb is used on drive c:, then the mapped owncloud drive will show that there is 58 gb used.  if you then attempt to copy a 3 gb file to the mapped owncloud drive, you will receive an out of space error from windows, even if the owncloud drive has 100's of gb of available space.\r\n\r\n### steps to reproduce\r\n1.  map owncloud in windows\r\n2. check drive space usage (in use/free) on windows
