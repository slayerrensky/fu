as mentioned on #2632: the â»change to password-type right before submitâ« seems a good solution.\r\n\r\niâ€™m not sure about the autocomplete=\"off\" because i think when that is in place the credentials wonâ€™t be remembered by the browser anymore, which is not good. or is it just for the dropdown? iâ€™m confused as to if it influences autocomplete (the dropdown) or autofill as well (the automatic filling of password etc, marks fields yellow). because the latter shout always work for the log in form for both username and password, and autocomplete for the username.\r\n\r\n@pikeypl can you also check if this solves the problem for you, while still autocompleting your password in the log in
