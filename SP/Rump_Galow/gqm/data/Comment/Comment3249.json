/ labels / categories are *more* useful and flexible than folders, in my opinion. it would be great to see owncloud leading the way forward with a tag-based file system or ui.\r\n\r\nfull text searching / indexing will cover words in a document, yes, but will not know how the user relates to a document. search results would also be cluttered up with less relevant matches that exist somewhere in a 50-page pdf but aren't related to the content the user wants.\r\n\r\ntags are intentional, in this case, and could be used to form collections (of documents, audio, pictures, etc.) that can be saved as a project homepage or even shared all at once. tags could also facilitate sharing (example: any files with tag \"clienta\" are shared with clienta). i believe you will see tags used by more people whenever it's better implemented in a
