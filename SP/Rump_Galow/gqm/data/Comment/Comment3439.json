definitely needs discussion on your side. it certainly has some drawbacks. maybe this should also be made optional.\r\n\r\ni'll explain why i did this:\r\ni used owncloud to share around 1.5 gb of files (one big movie, and a lot of photo jpegs) with a group of people. most of them want to download the whole package. even a single download of this made i/o my server go quite mad (the data and temp are on the same sw raid 1). it would take minutes before the download of the zip file would even start. the user does not see any progress in this time. i found that it is quite inefficient to copy every file to a temp file, and zip these in a temp file, so i searched for a php library that would directly zip and stream to the client. i found two solutions, that both did not work correctly or did not have the ability to work on a file handle as input, so i put the zipstreamer class together myself, and tested it with owncloud and my application scenario. with this solution, the download starts immediately and is fast with very low i/o and cpu usage.\r\n\r\nas i'm not familiar with the internals of owncloud and also not a php specialist, i can not tell if there are no major drawbacks or problems i missed, so i wanted to put the idea and the seemingly working solution to your attention. i felt that the main application of the zip functionality is to be able to download a lot of files/file hierarchies with one download. i think compression is secondary in this respect. i also felt that if the archive to be build grows large (as in several hundred mb or more), working with two temporary files per download would be an i/o problem.\r\n\r\nas for your concerns, and the pros and cons:\r\n- x-sendfile and x-accel are disabled when streaming zip files in this approach. i do not know about this mechanisms, but they indeed seem to require physical files. i think that creating a large temporary file (that can take minutes, in fact) will slow down at lot more than can be regained, but correct me if i'm mislead.\r\n- the data is in fact zipped, but no longer compressed. the zipstreamer class works on chunks of 1mb. chunk-wise compression (with deflate, the standard zip compression) is standardized and certainly possible, but i found no way to do it by builtin php means (although there are several ways in php to deflate). it would be easy to extend zipstreamer to compress all files that are smaller than the chunk size, and maybe increase the chunk size so \"most\" files would be compressed - on the other hand, most big files maybe are movies or jpegs anyway, where compression does not help much, if at all.\r\nit would also be possible to extend zipstreamer to do chunk-wise compression if someone found a way to do it with the php functions. i think reimplementing it *in php* would not perform very well, but it might also be possible.\r\n- the memory impact should be minimal. as i said, the zipstreamer works on 1 mb chunks, and each chunk is send to the client immediately. i think ziparchive will internally also work with chunks, but i don't know which size it uses. but the chunk size can simply be changed, also.\r\n\r\nso, as final word: probably, the implementation is not perfect. i'm happy to help make it better; i'm also not mad if it is completely rejected, but i think it is a direction that's worth a look at.\r\n\r\nps: i'm not sure what is with the whitespaces. maybe dos line endings? my tortoisegit showed the diff correctly."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/18217522","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/3439#issuecomment-18217522","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/3439","id":18217522,"user":{"login":"mtgap","id":1097106,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/454a73ee5feeb428d0c163a48903332c?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f52d29a66f285a1d61125dd69ac0766b2.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"454a73ee5feeb428d0c163a48903332c","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap","html_url":"https://github.com/mtgap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-05-21t15:42:02z","updated_at":"2013-05-21t15:42:02z","body":">
