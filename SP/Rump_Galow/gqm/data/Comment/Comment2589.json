the point has been made that oc is the only filemanager that defaults to showing files that are intended to be hidden. this has apparently been an arbitrary decision, for what i suspect to be ideological reasons.\r\nb) a simple configuration toggle would alleviate this problem for everyone. heck, default it to \"show invisible files\"\r\n\r\nas for the concerns by various participants in this thread:\r\n\r\n@deepdiver1975 : \"ok - these file got uploaded and i cannot see them. how can i remove them?\"\r\n\r\nthe mac file system will take care of removing them, when/if they are removed via the same webdav avenue.\r\ncaveat: if the main file is removed via the web-interface, the dot-associated files wouldn't be removed. a subroutine in the 'file delete' routine could check if there are files with the same file name, preceded by \"._\" and thus remove them automatically.\r\n\r\nfinally, you can always log in with a regular ftp client that supports webdav, and which allows toggling displaying or not hidden files, and deleting them that way. i just tested it via transmit (an ftp client) and it works fine. so, removal is a non-issue.\r\n\r\n@deepdiver1975 : \" afaik mac os is duplicating the files in the .ds - right?\" \r\n\r\nthat is incorrect. .ds_store files only contain desktop configuration information (ie location and state of folders) and in an ideal world should not be removed, just kept invisible. since they are minimal text files, quota impact is irrelevant.\r\n\r\n@kondou-ger : \"imo these files shouldn't be uploaded by a client, except especially told to do so.\"\r\n\r\nas pointed out, this is not an optional choice for users using a mac. these files are operating system specific, no different than .htaccess files, or other dot-files used in unix (which are routinely defaulted to invisible by all other file managers)\r\n\r\nplease, i beg those who are capable of instituting these changes, to at least consider my arguments. essentially, without this small change, the ability to connect via webdav directly from the mac's finder is, essentially, worthless.\r\n\r\nwith this feature, oc would be an awesome client for the mac
