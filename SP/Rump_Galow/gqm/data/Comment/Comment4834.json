ran on this issue as well today (with 5.0.13). i moved one of my root folder in another one in the webinterface (by mistake). i then moved it back in the original place and i noticed my client was removing plenty of my files from my local computer. when going to the directory in the web interface, i indeed saw many folders missing though i checked they were present on the server file system. \r\ni could look at the content of the directories also by appending ?dir=//dirname to the address but they were not added back. i had to issue truncate oc_filecache in the owncloud database.\r\n\r\nthis is an aspect of cloud i am a bit afraid of (losing data on one side would be repercuted everywhere) and preventing me to fully use this solution."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/30735165","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/4834#issuecomment-30735165","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/4834","id":30735165,"user":{"login":"forumschlampe","id":5485277,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/c3d3abed5dff1def46a992346d3920f6?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2fdaa17c4e1c7a752303eca546004ac534.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"c3d3abed5dff1def46a992346d3920f6","url":"https://api.github.com/users/forumschlampe","html_url":"https://github.com/forumschlampe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forumschlampe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forumschlampe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forumschlampe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forumschlampe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forumschlampe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forumschlampe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forumschlampe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forumschlampe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forumschlampe/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-12-17t08:59:30z","updated_at":"2013-12-17t08:59:30z","body":"experienced
