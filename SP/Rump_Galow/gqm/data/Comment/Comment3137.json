karyon, i installed the latest msi version 5.3.23 at the time. \r\n\r\nnow i've followed your tips and upgraded php to 5.4.14 (nts) and used php manager for iis.\r\n\r\nit now seems to work exactly as you described - showing folders and files with english characters. better than nothing indeed!\r\n\r\nedit: opening subfolders took a long while just after adding them, but i think that was due to owncloud doing some kind of indexing since i just added tons of folders. five minutes later it was opening subfolders quickly again :)\r\n\r\nthanks for the tip. still need support for norwegian ã¦/ã†
