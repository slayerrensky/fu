reproduce the issue i only have to enable ldap and leave a client running that uses an ldap account.  the client will error out frequently but still work and it will eventually knock apache over without producing anything useful in a log file that could be used to narrow the issue down.  apache shows \"server reached maxrequestworkers setting\" in the logs, which is a result of owncloud connections not closing, not load or config settings being too low.  ldap logs show nothing and seem totally unaffected by any of this as the dozen other things that use it for auth all work.  owncloud shows nothing in the logs right up until the end, just showing the above errors that don't really make sense unless it's trying to connect to a backup ldap server which i do not have configured.\r\n\r\nas far as ldap goes this is a 389 directory server.  the config settings as pulled from mysql are listed below (sanitized).  if it's not listed it's empty.  these config settings

sounds like an configuration issue. is it possible that the ldap server has a limit of maximum connections that is lower than the maximum number of apache/php/owncloud processed?  the ldap server connection ttl has to be taken into account too. this works just fine in a lot of other scenarios so i assume the ldap server here is somehow slowing down php/owncloud which will lead to the high number of blocking processes/connections.
