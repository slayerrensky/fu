the password for the last logged in user, even though the password is saved in windows credential manager. i tried saving in credential manager with the location set to the ip address and the ip address with the full path (http://172.22.0.14/owncloud/remote.php/webdav).\r\n\r\n### steps to reproduce\r\n1. open map network drive dialog on windows \r\n2. check \"reconnect at login\"\r\n3. login to network drive with different user cedentials and check \"remember my credentials\"\r\n4. reboot\r\n5. network drive will not have deconnected at login. a password will be asked for when
