@dalwhinnie i just opened a pull request which changes the behaviour a bit. with the pull request following will happen:\r\n\r\n- if a admin changes a password from a user with recovery enabled we generate a new key pair for the user and recover the files\r\n- if a admin changes a password from a user without recovery enabled only the log-in password will change. if the user log-in with the new password he will get a warning that the key password no longer matches his recovery password. the user than can change the key password to the new login password in the personal settings if he remembers the old password\r\n- if the user no longer remembers the old password and really need a new account with new keys than the admin needs to delete the users private/public key. if the user log-in again new keys will be created. also if the admin changes the password for a user without a recovery key and without a existing key pair, new keys will be created.\r\n\r\nif you want you can try the patch.\r\n\r\n> allow the admin to active recovery for users (and maybe warn users on next login that recovery is activated now in order to allow them to opt out)\r\n\r\ni think for privacy reasons opt-in is the better solution. the admin shouldn't be able to force recovery mode on the user. i also don't like annoying pop-ups asking the user questions. the encryption app already has quite some warnings and error message. this would also not help the admin to quickly change the users password. because in order to make the recovery key useful all keyfiles from the user need to be encrypted with the recovery key. this can't be triggered by the admin."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/29973187","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/6204#issuecomment-29973187","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/6204","id":29973187,"user":{"login":"dalwhinnie","id":6112935,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/56814ffe90489e44f4e3885775e7e72f?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2fe99a000aeb091a7056af876e5b2062ef.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"56814ffe90489e44f4e3885775e7e72f","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalwhinnie","html_url":"https://github.com/dalwhinnie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalwhinnie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalwhinnie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalwhinnie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalwhinnie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalwhinnie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalwhinnie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalwhinnie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalwhinnie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalwhinnie/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-12-06t09:04:53z","updated_at":"2013-12-06t09:04:53z","body":"thanks
