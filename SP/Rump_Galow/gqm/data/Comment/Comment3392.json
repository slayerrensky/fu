well, that wasn't much fun thanks to google and their drive api, but i think i solved the problem. could you test it and let me know? it ignores the first batch of changes it gets because i assume the scan just happened which isn't true in your case. so you'll want to go into the folder on owncloud first and then try doing changes on google drive. it isn't the greatest solution, but it's better than always forcing a rescan.\r\n\r\nand the upload problem you're experiencing is probably because owncloud couldn't determine the mimetype for your jar file, but it's still their fault. the api
