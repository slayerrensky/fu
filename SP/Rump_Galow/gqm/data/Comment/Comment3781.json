when i checked the folder data/user/files_trashbin/files - itâ´s empty. \r\n\r\nthan the trash bin works correctly. i think the easiest way to find out what allocates your disk space is by checking the various folders. maybe you have large system tmp files or system log files, etc. as for owncloud everything should be in the data directory, so you can scan the data directory and its sub folders to find out if there are large files which shouldn't be there.\r\n\r\nthe web server log is normally located in
