nice to see someone else interested in improving the search! may i ask you to consider search lucene simple (#849) as the basis for your efforts? if you want to learn about tf-idf algorithms go ahead and write your own app. but i strongly suggest using php search lucene as the basis. it already has a working indexer for plain text, html and pdf.\r\n\r\nmy idea is to create a search framework where we can exchange the implementation backend to improve performance or use indexing mechanisms already present in the system, eg. a clucene, beagle, strigi or trackerd - or your own algorithm. i actually looked into this pull request, but unfortunately, i'm quite busy polishing other customer issues. you correctly noticed the ideas discussed in #821 would require a rework of the files app which you already started with this app. i will update the search_lucene_simple branch and would be super happy if you merged this pr there so we can work on #821 together with @jancborchardt.\r\n\r\nmoving to asynchronous indexing based on the background jobs infrastructure in master should solve the performance problems of search lucene simple (#849). the 'simple' is based on the fact that i already tried implementing an asynchronous indexing before we had a proper 'cron' in place, so i wanted to try the simple 'index on write' strategy.\r\n\r\nimplementing an endless scroll should address any search result related performance problems.\r\n\r\nso please, pretty please, try enhancing #849 before writing your own tf-idf algorithm & app
