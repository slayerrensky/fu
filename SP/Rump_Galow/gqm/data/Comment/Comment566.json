features of `sabre_dav_client` is that it's possible to specify a proxy. i don't know if you guys also expose that setting somewhere, but by setting this up it should become a lot easier to log this stuff through charles.\r\n\r\nthe other option is to setup charles as a reverse proxy.. you point it to a remote server, and just connect from owncloud straight to charles, instead of your usual server.\r\n\r\nthe one thing i did notice:\r\n\r\nthe client is repeatedly trying to create the /cloud collection with mkcol, even though it already exists. i'm not sure if this could be the cause of
