emerzh programmed a possibility to add ocâ´s sql queries. this is great, but these queries are by his design only written to the standard log.\r\n\r\n2.) it is not a good idea to have tonâ´s of sql logs in the same log than oc writes itâ´s own logs to. just try to filter a oc problem in a huge list of sql log entries. (give it a try and watch with tail -f)\r\n\r\n3.) if you enable the possibility to write sql statements in a separated log, you could easily do a little more thinking and open the coding in a way to be independent of emerzhâ´s sql logging and use whatever logfile you want for whatever purpose you need.\r\n\r\n4.) there are more than tonâ´s of issues around with music and gallery. it is now much easier to write a log entry to a particular file separated from oc log to monitor progress or problems. for development a big benefit.\r\n \r\n5.) i see ocâ´s log as the core for problems coming up to be monitored and in normal circumastances you are not using these additional logging features. but when you need to monitor particular behaviours you need logiles which are easy to handle and can be turned on and off as needed seperated from the oc log.\r\n\r\n6.) not all of us have access to eg the database log, because they host at a provider (thatâ´s the reason why emerzh wrote the stuff)\r\n\r\n7.) when i do testing, i have several terminal windows open. i am tailing following logs in parallel: owncloud.log, apache_error.log, apache_access.log ect. with big hope, nothing is happening. but when stuff goes wrong, you need data, quick and easy. my last test ran >48h. it was just to scan my music files (~13.000). i needed to stop because there are massive runtime problems and the task not seens to end. now think how you will find a issue having all logs combined.\r\n\r\nit is btw not complicated. it is easy, because it gives the freedom to write logs where you need it
