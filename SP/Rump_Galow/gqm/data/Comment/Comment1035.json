reverseproxyhost is needed to detect when owncloud is used via reverse proxy (a). it is also possible to use owncloud direct (b) without reverse proxy. in my case the reverse proxy is only used for the https connection, but in both cases onwcloud itself is served via http. the reverseproxyprefix[ssl] is used by the reverse proxy to distinguish between the different host it has to managed. it is possible to use only one prefix if we can assume that they are always the same. the overwrite variables are *always* overwrite the host and protocol.\r\n\r\nexample: owncloud is installed on a domain.tld without ssl certificate. the web hosting provider has one reverse proxy ssl-proxy.tld with a ssl certificate in the computing centre which allows https connection via the url https://ssl-proxy.tld/domain.tld/. in both cases the connection to the web server is via http but with the reverse proxy the data are encrypted outside of the computing centre. in order to support both connections owncloud has to use the default behaviour for the direct http connection and it has to use the ssl-proxy.tld host and domain.tld web root prefix for the https connection. the detection of the host and protocol works via http_x_forwarded variables. only the prefix must be set manually and therefor owncloud has to detect the reverse proxy via ip or hostname. the current
