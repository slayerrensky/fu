so why can't i use the $user variable in the mount.json where the mount destination is configured. it's fine for the file location within oc5 but not when i put it in the mount destination. i have tried both manually editing the json and  using the gui. the gui rejects my $user.\r\n\r\nthe destination i am using exactly is /mnt/staff/$user. i have had this working in oc4 but not oc5. i am trying to access ldap home directories on a windows share on windows server."}]
