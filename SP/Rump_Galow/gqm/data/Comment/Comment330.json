code looks good to me, so :+1: \r\n\r\nbut i also agree with michael that the best solution would be if all apps which need internet/network connection would check this as part of the error handling and notify the user straight away. e.g. if i go to the external storage settings a warning should appear right beside the setting if owncloud can't connect to one of the servers, the update notifier should say \"can't check for updates, please check your internet connection\" and so on.\r\n\r\ni would suggest to use your solution for now but think about how to integrate it better into the apps for the future."}]
