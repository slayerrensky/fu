i only know the databade locking migration problems that can/show be fixed by us. totally possible.\r\n\r\ni'm referring to the database lockings, sure they *are* fixable, but really we have much bigger problems to solve and just saying \"fix it\" does not solve the problem at all. if someone volunteers to fix all those database locks where we have no idea where they come from, he/she is more than welcome.\r\n\r\nthere are other big projects like [gitlabhq](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq) that realised that sqlite is not maintainable with all those unneeded [database locks](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/wiki/migrate-from-sqlite-to-mysql). investing time to fix this lockup issues is just a waste of time since it is much easier to just force the user to use a proper database.\r\n\r\nsqlite is fine for desktop applications, but it's not really the best choice for web applications. and even nearly every \"wald und wiesen-hoster\" is offering mysql since it is used by nearly all php applications out there. (and if he doesn't offer an appropriate db the owncloud instance will slow down anyway because of other problems)\r\n\r\nanyways: just choosing sqlite as standard is more than ridiculous, it tells the user that he will get the best experience with this setup which is just not true. and we all know our users: 70% of them won't read the documentation or click \"advanced\".\r\n\r\n(another point is the security, while most proper database setups restrict the login to \"localhost\" it's possible for an attacker to download the whole sqlite db once he found a vulnerability to download arbitrary files. (e.g. the recent sabredav vuln) and this is certainly not good
