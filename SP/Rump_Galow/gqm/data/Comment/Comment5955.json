functionality to make the changes work immediately.\r\nthe current behaviour seems to be: make changes in the wizard --> wait for ldap cache ttl --> see changes (tryed that one with the userlist and viewing all useres)\r\nif you click the button save config on the advanced tab changes work immediately. so it might be better to reset the ldap cache after clicking the continue button. this leaves
