but visible to internal users, we have done this by creating groups, adding internal users to all required groups, so they can view all the assets.  as we continue to add more clients, we will contine to create more groups and add internal users to those groups, this is going to be a problem eventually to see if a user is in certain groups or not.\r\n\r\n![owncloud_users_group](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/3833140/918970/71a593bc-febf-11e2-9e13-1bba90876bdf.jpg)\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/22200626","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/3708#issuecomment-22200626","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/3708","id":22200626,"user":{"login":"mtrichards","id":1818977,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/a1655fd2e819638708ee854fa941008b?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2fa75d8baded229745ad65d43f7a7975df.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"a1655fd2e819638708ee854fa941008b","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtrichards","html_url":"https://github.com/mtrichards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtrichards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtrichards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtrichards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtrichards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtrichards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtrichards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtrichards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtrichards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtrichards/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-06t18:34:17z","updated_at":"2013-08-06t18:34:17z","body":"comments

as you see the groups dropdown expands to the width it can take. naturally if a user is in more than 6 groups or so (greatly depending on screen width), only the first ones are actually directly visible in the row. for more info you just have to click on the dropdown to make it expand. the groups in which the user is (the checked ones) should show up first, so you quickly see which groups this user is in."}]
