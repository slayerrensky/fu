because you upgrade these components on purpose and you are in the position to adopt the changed api calls.\r\nwith owncloud the aim is quite different - more comparable to mobile platforms - as soon as you break the api most probably a lot of apps will not work any more. this is not acceptable for us.\r\nand that's why we actually need to separate implementation from api
