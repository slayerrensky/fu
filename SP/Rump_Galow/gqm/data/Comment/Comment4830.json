i will try to explain how that append.\r\nfirst i've installed owncloud version 5.0.10. i was the only one user and admin.\r\ni used the same password for all password fields.\r\ni've also install owncloud client on my laptop osx and linux.\r\neverything was fine exept that sometime i was not able to edit or view any file directly from web browser.\r\ni was forced to login, goto admin, and put my password in both old and new in \"change encryption passwords recovery key\". that's why i've decided to update to owncloud 5.0.11, hopping that this would be resolved. unfortunately the same issue is present in the new version, worst even if i put the same password in old and new field i'm no more able to open my files. i've just discovered that if i create a new file from web interface i'm not able to save tit. the file is created in the server, but it is empty and i can not save any content.\r\n\r\nthank you.\r\nregards.\r\ncharlie"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/24559438","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/4830#issuecomment-24559438","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/4830","id":24559438,"user":{"login":"rap2013","id":5450937,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/010a9f075ac347cdef133840e23828e3?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f8300a4a0997abc4a95cad4c266023db7.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"010a9f075ac347cdef133840e23828e3","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rap2013","html_url":"https://github.com/rap2013","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rap2013/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rap2013/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rap2013/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rap2013/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rap2013/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rap2013/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rap2013/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rap2013/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rap2013/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-09-17t02:07:54z","updated_at":"2013-09-17t02:07:54z","body":"in
