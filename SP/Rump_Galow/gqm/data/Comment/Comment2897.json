does it contain any special characters, spaces, etc. normally this shouldn't make any difference but at least it would be something which could be checked."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/16407828","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/2897#issuecomment-16407828","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/2897","id":16407828,"user":{"login":"jps24","id":3011739,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/2b00312aad4fb7c58fb2d672d75e833c?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2fb308bd8e6490a21c413f58dc8fbc317d.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"2b00312aad4fb7c58fb2d672d75e833c","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jps24","html_url":"https://github.com/jps24","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jps24/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jps24/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jps24/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jps24/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jps24/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jps24/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jps24/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jps24/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jps24/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-04-15t19:59:53z","updated_at":"2013-04-15t20:01:11z","body":"@schiesbn \r\nthanks for your reply! there are no special characters in the foldername but i played around a bit more and tried moving several subfolders from the directory to see if that changes something. it did not but afterwards i tried renaming the mount itself in oc's admin-ui and voilã  another mount was created that did work! after that i tried to create the mount with the original name again and now trash bin works with that as well. i don't quite understand the logic behind that but i'm  really happy it's working now! ;)   "}]
