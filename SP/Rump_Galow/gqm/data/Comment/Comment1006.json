test this issue, i uploaded a file of 835 mb using firefox 17.0.1, which took almost 3.5 hours with my connection. i used the webdeveloper console to track the progress (see below for its output). the owncloud version is 4.5.5 (4.90.6).\r\n\r\nin the end, after the upload is done, an error is logged (\"syntaxerror: json.parse: unexpected character\"), which might indicate a problem with the response body of the upload request. i didn't log the reponse body, unfortunately, so i don't know what it was exactly.\r\n\r\nin the webdeveloper console i could see that about every 55 minutes an ajax request to refresh the request token (\"lifebeat\") was issued.\r\n\r\nthe problem seems to be that while the first of these requests does send the same request token as was sent by the initial file upload, the subsequent refresh requests had the request header value for the request token as \"undefined\". i've seen some work on the request token code in git (e.g. issue #159), maybe there's still an issue with that?\r\n\r\nalso, after the upload has failed, opening a new tab or reloading the page shows me the login page, indicating that my php session has expired.\r\n\r\ni can see what i suspect to be the session cookie having been sent with all requests which should keep the php session alive, given that it has a lifetime of 60 minutes. so while the php session probably stayed alive, the request token did not? but why the login page hinting at an expiration of the php session as well? as for the json parsing error, i suspect that the upload request reponse body contained an error or maybe even html for the login page, which couldn't be parsed.\r\n\r\ni hope this helps.\r\n\r\n\r\nconsole output with some additional information (indented):\r\n\r\n```\r\n[12:46:03.761] post
