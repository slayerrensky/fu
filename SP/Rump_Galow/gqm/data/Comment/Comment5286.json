too, think that this change is a major drawback.\r\n\r\nif someone checks \"stay logged in\" he/she will never see the login page again. thus it only has to be checked once.\r\n\r\nif someone doesn't want to stay checked in he/she has to uncheck the checbox at every login. this is at least annoying. \r\n\r\nin case your working on someone elses device it is a security issue if you forget to uncheck the checkbox! (sure, you can logout, delete cockies, ...) the default has alwasy to be the safe decision.\r\n\r\nif you wanted to chage the old behavior you should have choosen to remember the setting used at the last login and use unchecked if there is no last setting."}]
