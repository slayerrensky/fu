a better approach is to add many small prs instead of one really big ... prepare your change step by step and the review will be a lot easier. ;) and don't forget to crosslink between them and mention people you think that they can review it - i.e. current maintainer of this code base or people showed up in this pr;)"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/20552409","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/1473#issuecomment-20552409","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/1473","id":20552409,"user":{"login":"bartv2","id":2227877,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/c2d86a0a66a4be2c904e24034e842f44?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f05e8b1362feb118a386dfd282b20fb84.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"c2d86a0a66a4be2c904e24034e842f44","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartv2","html_url":"https://github.com/bartv2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartv2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartv2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartv2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartv2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartv2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartv2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartv2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartv2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartv2/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-07-06t10:30:47z","updated_at":"2013-07-06t10:30:47z","body":"@andrewsbrown

@butonic: so the first thing i think i need is good search results. right now, oc_search_result is a pretty bare affair and if i need search results with as much data as possible. in my implementation, each search result type (e.g. oc_search_result_file or oc_search_result_event) has its inherited properties--name, id, etc.--but is extended with applicable properties for that type--created, modified, etc. that is one way to do that, but perhaps a more extensible way is to have a separate column type and add column data as an object; either way, the goal is to have as much data as possible in the search result so that results can be sorted or queried further.\r\n\r\nso, besides more data, the other thing they need are actions. right now i am creating those the hard way inside a formattohtml() method; i think this definitely needs to have it's own separate class so i don't have to keep mixing in html with the actual code. an action class would have a title, a url, and permissions; the provider would add actions to each search result, e.g. an oc_search_result_file would have actions like 'download', 'edit', 'delete', etc.\r\n\r\nif i had those two things, columns and actions, it would be a good start. the problem is that all of the apps are entrenched in the current search provider/result system and require significant tweaking to change. that's why i went ahead and wrote new providers and new search results for all of the apps included in the 'apps' repository; and that's why this pull request looks so massive. in other words, to make search better/more extensible/more useful in the future, i think we need to significantly modify the current search pattern. but, again, it's a lot of change."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/20593361","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/1473#issuecomment-20593361","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/1473","id":20593361,"user":{"login":"karlitschek","id":867445,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/87ce2b4531ee1a0c32b50e0d8f049224?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f06e7098636caebfc9c30c9f52eb905df.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"87ce2b4531ee1a0c32b50e0d8f049224","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek","html_url":"https://github.com/karlitschek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-07-08t09:05:02z","updated_at":"2013-07-08t09:05:02z","body":"i

general i like the current solution that returns the search results as json. that also works when subclassing the 'abstract' or generic search result. imo we should change `oc_search_result` into an adapter for the new `\\oc\\search\\result\\generic` class that implements the `\\oc\\search\\result` interface with the four currently used members $name, $text $link and $type. $type currently is documented as `the type of result as human readable string ('file', 'music', etc)` i would rather use it to coose the javascript renderer that creates the html for this type of result. that way subclasses like `\\oc\\search\\result\\contact` can set $type to `contact` and add an $image. on the client side the contacts app can register a handler for this type of search results and show the contact $image in front of the $name.\r\n\r\n@andrewsbrown could you create a pr that contains the new `\\oc\\search\\result`, `\\oc\\search\\result\\generic` and converts `oc_search_result` into a legacy adapter? that should give us a start for a cleaner and more flexible internal search code. i guess the fill and format methods are not yet necessary (and i prefer that kind of code on the client)?\r\n\r\nafter that we can work on the client side solution. there is already a customization approach but only the text editor, the deprecated imageviewer, bookmarks and the media app use it. `grep -r oc.search.customresults *` should give you the files.  instead of just customizing the result i would hand over the complete html generation for the search result to them. if no special renderer is found we can use the generic renderer (which dedicated renderers can use to get the basic html for a search result). the changes should not be that big.\r\n\r\none step after another, and
