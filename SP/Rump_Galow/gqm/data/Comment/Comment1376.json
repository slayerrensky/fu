\nor not). so this is something where constant frustration and confusion will \nresult from. that is not good. \ni don't really understand why it should not be possible to use an arbitrary \nname as an apps folder. certainly that involves clean escaping of paths all \nthe time. but from another point of view not doing so and hoping that only \naccepting a few characters as part of a name prevents problems is nothing but \n'hoping that things wong break then' and thus something like a poor mans \nsolution. \neither all (sane) characters are allowed as part of a name or manual \ninstallation that way must be prevented. \n\nwhat about introducing a different solution for manual installations? makes \nmore sense in my eyes anyway: \na button \"manual installation\" that accepts a file archive. that archive is \ninstalled just like those downloaded from the app store. this way the folders \nname is set by the oc application which is cleaner anyway. \n\nchristian reiner (arkascha)\n[
