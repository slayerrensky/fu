there is no config option yet. the only think you can adjust is how long a file stays in the trash bin. by default a file gets deleted if it is older than 180 days or if the size limit is met. this is necessary to manage the disk space of the user efficient and still keep the trash bin working. in most cases this function will only remove some old files from the trash bin to have enough space for newer files. but if you running short of memory or if you delete really old files it can happen that all files get removed. basically this is a trade off between the trash bin and your files. if you running out of memory we consider space for your actual files more important thanb having access to many deleted files.\r\n\r\nby the way, i just saw that my explanation was not accurate. we don't use 50% of the quota in total but 50% of your available quota at the time the expire function was called. for example: you have a total quota (or disk space) of 1000mb, at the beginning the trash bin is allowed to use 500mb. if you use 80% for your actual files (800mb) than the trash bin is allowed to store files up to 100 mb (50% from 200mb (1000mb-800mb))\r\n\r\ni suggested a pull request to write a information to the log file once a file gets expired. i hope this will make it more transparent for the user:
