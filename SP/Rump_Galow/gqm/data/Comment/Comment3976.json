this is seemingly a browser issue which also varies across browsers. simple html and css does not really help here, but rather there would need to be some javascript/jquery solution as suggested in the stackoverflow thread which @deepdiver1975 pointed out.\r\n\r\nthe issue is that we have quite a lot of js in use already and we’re looking to reduce the introduction of more, at least for
