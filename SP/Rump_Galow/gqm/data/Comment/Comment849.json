i first want to see if this matches the direction of the project. since i am not very familiar with the github distributed workflow, please let me know how to post this (as a branch on 'core'?) so that someone can review the code. right now i am working in https://github.com/andrewsbrown/owncloud-core/tree/required_improvements_for_search4 and

fosdem i found the time to split some of the code and create separate pull requests of which the core part for removing a search provider has been merged just in time for oc5: #1413 \r\nat fosdem i discussed a minimal implementation of full text search with @jancborchardt and @karlitschek. the result is a pr in the apps repository that adds the search_lucene app: https://github.com/owncloud/apps/pull/513\r\n\r\nthat is all i could do to get an initial full text search into owncloud before having to dedicate more time to a customer project. i hope @karlitschek packages search_lucene for the oc5 alpha so people interested can activate it, test it and send feedback.\r\n\r\nthis leaves us with the filter instead of search gui, which is where @andrewsbrown has already done a ton of work! :rocket:\r\n\r\n@andrewsbrown since you already did a lot of work there i'll close this pull request and kindly ask you to create new pull requests from the two branches you mentioned. you already did the right thing with forking core and apps on github. https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests should help you with creating pull requests for them.\r\n\r\nyou should maybe merge the latest core master branch and the search_lucene apps branch \r\n(https://github.com/owncloud/apps/pull/513). with a pr in place we can start reviewing the changes you made and discuss feedback from other developers. in the pr please also mention @jancborchardt to comment on the filtered results ui. @jancborchardt or do you already have some mockups?\r\n\r\ni hope we did not duplicate too much effort since i just had a look at some of your commits and saw e.g. the unregister search provider commit. but it seems you added a lot more features.\r\n\r\nit would be really awesome to have this work ready for oc6."}]
