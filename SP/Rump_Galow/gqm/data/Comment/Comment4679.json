i had to say this but i don't really like the idea of having a multi-select in group admin. its superb for selecting multiple groups for a user but not for selecting group admin. since we have a whole sidebar of groups and users are displayed according to groups.\r\n\r\nlets take a test case : \r\n\r\ni am assuming that if a user is group admin of a particular group he has to be a part of it, at least, so when i am in say \"group1\" i should only have the option of promoting the user of that very group to its admin. a checkbox is enough to do that imo.\r\nwhy should i be making a user group admin of \"group2\" from the \"group1\" list when i don't know he is in \"group1\" or not? it simply doesn't make sense.\r\n\r\nthe concept is fine in master as there is no group filter but in my branch, there is a filter already. so just tweaking a checkbox is enough to promote a user to a group admin for that particular group.\r\n\r\nanother negative of this is when i added a group sidebar and avatars. they take a decent amount of space from the left which makes having 2 multiselects on the right very very cluttered. its so cluttered that i cant see more than 2 groups in the multiselect title(for users who are a part of more than 4-5 groups is horrible.)\r\n\r\nwhat hat i suggest is to get a button / checkbox in front of a user so that he can be promoted to the admin of that particular group. also it adds a class that gives that row a slight highlight.\r\n\r\n what do you guys think? i can give mockups of this looks bad, i have tried it tested it. :\\ cc @jancborchardt

with raghu here: it makes absolutely no sense imo to have a seperate filter for all group admins. if you want to see all group admins of group x click on the group x entry. the group admins are sorted up and maybe colored distinguishable to see them at a glance.\r\n\r\nanother thing that i dislike is having the add group at the bottom of the left list. dont we have a convention (notes, news, contacts, etc) to have the plus button to add stuff at the very top? same goes for adding users: the first entry in the user list should contain the form elements to add another user. that way we can

so letâ€™s say every user only has a checkbox for being group admin. 2 big questions arise:\r\n1. how do i manage group admins in the â»everyoneâ« view?\r\n2. how do i see which groups this person is group admin of?\r\non top of that, having the checkbox left of the user is like the files selection of multiple elements â€“ which it isnâ€™t in this case, hence confusing.\r\n\r\nhaving the same multiselect for selecting group admins was an informed decision based on the use cases, please donâ€™t just remove it. space is not really an issue because we can always ellipsize or size constrain what is shown of the group dropdown.\r\n\r\nthe user row should be exactly the same whichever group i am in. the multiselect for groups also shows all groups: i can add the user to group2 while iâ€™m in the view for group1, so it should be possible to also make them group admin of any group from any view. when making a user group admin of a group they are not part of yet, they should be added to it automatically as a member as well.\r\n\r\n@raydiation i think you misunderstand @raghunayyarâ€™s question there. he wasnâ€™t asking about a filter for group admins (in the left sidebar), but about the multiselect in the user row for selecting which groups this user is admin for.\r\ni do agree with your other points though:\r\n* â»new groupâ« (please rename it from â»add groupâ«) should be at the top of the left list (or rather below the fixed groups â»everyoneâ«, â»adminsâ« etc.) â€“ didnâ€™t know you changed that @raghunayyar?\r\n* â»new userâ« should also be at the very top of the list. the whole row should be clickable to reveal the input fields, the input fields should not be visible at all times. and it should not be a fixed top bar, but rather scroll with the content.
