with admin\r\n3.- check, using another web browser, that the folder is correctly shared with admin\r\n4.- refresh the user1 account \r\n5.- the \"shared icon\" is not any longer shown, although if we click on it, we see that that folder is shared with user2, indeed, it is still available on the shared folder on admin\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror\t search_lucene\t need mimetype for content extraction\t
