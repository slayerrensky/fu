also, if the admin provides the db name, owner and password i don't think the installer logic should try to second-guess the admin. \r\n\r\ni also tried to set up oc by copying config/config.sample.php to config.php and setting the required values by hand. the installer kept ignoring the config and overwriting it even though i had set \"installed\" => true."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/20776173","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/1263#issuecomment-20776173","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/1263","id":20776173,"user":{"login":"kondou-ger","id":1410802,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/917dab919ae812f8252b2f501c514b19?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2fd07869ed62cb1b7f88b731956ab913ee.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"917dab919ae812f8252b2f501c514b19","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kondou-ger","html_url":"https://github.com/kondou-ger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kondou-ger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kondou-ger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kondou-ger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kondou-ger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kondou-ger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kondou-ger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kondou-ger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kondou-ger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kondou-ger/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-07-10t21:52:57z","updated_at":"2013-07-10t21:52:57z","body":"did #867 fix this?"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/26505415","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/1263#issuecomment-26505415","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/1263","id":26505415,"user":{"login":"karlitschek","id":867445,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/87ce2b4531ee1a0c32b50e0d8f049224?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f06e7098636caebfc9c30c9f52eb905df.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"87ce2b4531ee1a0c32b50e0d8f049224","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek","html_url":"https://github.com/karlitschek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-10-17t13:46:31z","updated_at":"2013-10-17t13:46:31z","body":"i assume this is fixed with https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/867 "}]
