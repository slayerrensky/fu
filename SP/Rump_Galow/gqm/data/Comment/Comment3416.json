files will be encrypted, independent from the storage. maybe in the future it will be possible to define it by storage or folder. keep in mind that server side encryption only provided real security for external storages. on the internal storage the admin will always be able to intercept your data since they get encrypted/decrypted on the owncloud server. so it would be strange to disable encryption only for external storages because that's where it is most useful."}]
