would be convenient to have a single link that you can quickly send to people so that they can send you files.  having to open owncloud, create a new folder, then configure the sharing permissions on that folder, each and every time you want a new person to be able to send you files, is a lot more work.  if there was a sharing option \"show anonymously-uploaded files within session only\" (probably with a better name), i would be able to keep a single link handy that i could send people, and they wouldn't be able to see each others' files."}]
