standard in plesk is 16mb. i found two possibilities to change that, and in combination with oc 5.06 and oc client 1.25 you really have to change both values. also very uggly problem. \r\n\r\nseems that pleak based systems are not ideal platform for oc hosting. pls see also next issue https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/3542 / endless upload - really overuggly problem. you've ever encountered similar problems ?\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nklaus"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/22796850","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/3541#issuecomment-22796850","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/3541","id":22796850,"user":{"login":"jancborchardt","id":925062,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f84ec51f9ceed468217d4e13abf78da9c.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt","html_url":"https://github.com/jancborchardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-16t22:02:05z","updated_at":"2013-08-16t22:02:05z","body":"i’m closing this issue because it has been inactive for a few months. this probably means that the issue is not reproducible or it has been fixed in a newer version.\r\n\r\nplease reopen if you still encounter this issue with the [latest stable version](http://owncloud.org/install/) (currently owncloud 5.0.10) and then please use the [issue template](https://raw.github.com/owncloud/core/master/issue_template.md). you an also contribute directly by providing a patch – see the [developer manual](http://doc.owncloud.org/server/5.0/developer_manual/). :)\r\n\r\nthank you!"}]
