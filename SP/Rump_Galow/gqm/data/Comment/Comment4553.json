implementation got merged, so i had to rebased this. @andrewsbrown there is a problem with the way we allow apps to customize the search results. currently only one customization callback is possible, so when files_texteditor is enabled the technical 'file' type id will currently not be translated. you may have stumbled over the comments about renderers for the search results. what is your opinion on that? the simple solution would be to use scrollto for all file based results and remove any search result customizations from files_texteditor (gallery and music currently don't customize the results).\r\n\r\n@tanghus and @georgehrke seem to be content with the default search result and only use the link to open contact / calender entries ... do those apps even have a search provider?\r\n\r\n@andrewsbrown with this pr we can return much more detailed json. now we need to think about how we handle that json on the client side. do we want to allow customization? i see the following use cases:\r\n* images open in the pictures app (but we need a way for the user to navigate to the corresponding file)\r\n* audio files ... show meta information instead of the filename? what about search results based on artist? @kabum what do you have planned for music?\r\n* for pdf we could scrollto the file, highlight it and open it in the pdf preview\r\n* as long as we don't have a dedicated video app the same goes for videos: scrollto in files, highlight and open videoplayer\r\n* texteditor ... not sure ... scrollto, highlight and open?\r\n\r\n@jancborchardt in general i see a difference between the scrollto action and a default opening action. using the default opening action as it exists in the files app is pointless, because the user then cannot share the file.\r\n\r\nin the short term i'd remove any customizations by apps (especially files) and always use scrollto. the user can then decide what to do based on the fileactions: delete, rename, share, or default action. at least that is what people expect when they are in the files app. when they are in another app or the advanced search app the default action might be a good idea ...

i completely agree that the search result customization is unnecessary and should be removed. the search box we are working on is a tiny little thing in the corner--with that much screen real estate,
