for the detailed report. i can reproduce it now.\r\n\r\nit seems like during the rename process both the file system cache and the oc_share table doesn't get updated correctly with the new file name. this causes the problem you described above.\r\nfurther, if the owner of the file logs into his owncloud his file cache will be updated (because the physical file was renamed correctly). this means that owncloud will assume that the original file was deleted and that the file with the new name is a completely new file. this will also result in a  lose of all shares defined for the original file before the rename action took place.\r\n\r\ni have to check if this can be solved with the file cache we use in oc4.5.\r\n\r\nwe should also make sure that this problem doesn't happen in oc5 with the new file cache!\r\n\r\ncc @icewind1991
