successfully?"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/11967694","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/1052#issuecomment-11967694","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/1052","id":11967694,"user":{"login":"mtgap","id":1097106,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/454a73ee5feeb428d0c163a48903332c?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f52d29a66f285a1d61125dd69ac0766b2.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"454a73ee5feeb428d0c163a48903332c","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap","html_url":"https://github.com/mtgap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-01-07t19:43:48z","updated_at":"2013-01-07t19:43:48z","body":"@schiesbn
