is something that can be implemented using a flash player fallback lib like soundmanager and i think that transcoding is a bad idea (ive also written an html5 audio player that tried to do this). apart from that iirc firefox will support mp3 soon. i hope you dont mind it if i close this issue. if you do, please reopen it in the apps repo instead

might be a bad idea as itself, but, unfortunately, it's just inevitable at the moment. flac is not supported by flash and there is no browser with support of any lossless codec in html5 <audio> tag. there exist some js-based flac decoders, but not none of them is cross-browser. thus, the only way to play lossless files in a web-based player nowdays is to transcode them to a universally supported format (i. e. mp3) on the fly. although, i found the original bug in apps repo, so this one must be closed
