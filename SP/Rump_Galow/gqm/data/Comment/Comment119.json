general, it should only be the last action available to undo.  the big one here is delete - and undo there moves it out of the trash back where it was.  if you select a whole stack of files and folders and delete them, then undo undoes them all - undo usually means \"oops, i take that back\". \r\n\r\nother undo options would be things like rename and move as well.  undo here is lower priority, but would be nice to have. undo would change names back to original names, and locations to original locations.\r\n\r\nversions...this is interesting.  i would like them to work independently, as people may or may not have the two turned on.  if they are both enabled, undo should track and undo changes to the appropriate versions too.  example: if i delete a file, versions go away too, but if i then undo the delete, then the versions should come back too, if the versions app is turned on.  if i delete a folder and hit undo, versions for everything in the folder should come back too.  if i move a folder, versions should move, and then undo would move them back as well - but again, these last two actions are less important than undelete."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/11769616","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/119#issuecomment-11769616","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/119","id":11769616,"user":{"login":"jlgg","id":3153405,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/b068b802e380419f7a3fc98133193448?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f991fcec5cec03a8ea3f8f0a124067c3b.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"b068b802e380419f7a3fc98133193448","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlgg","html_url":"https://github.com/jlgg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlgg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlgg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlgg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlgg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlgg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlgg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlgg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlgg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlgg/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-12-30t22:39:34z","updated_at":"2012-12-30t22:39:34z","body":"as
