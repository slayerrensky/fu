(btw, that had been the reason why it has worked when the `cron.php` file was called from within the web browser.)\r\nthe php binary reads its configuration from the `/etc/php5/cli`directory and after creating a symbolic link in this directory, which points to the original `mysql.ini` file, the error disappeared instantly.\r\n\r\n@shtrom: could you please check if you could solve the problem on your server by applying this fix.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/26501828","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/3505#issuecomment-26501828","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/3505","id":26501828,"user":{"login":"karlitschek","id":867445,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/87ce2b4531ee1a0c32b50e0d8f049224?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f06e7098636caebfc9c30c9f52eb905df.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"87ce2b4531ee1a0c32b50e0d8f049224","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek","html_url":"https://github.com/karlitschek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-10-17t13:00:18z","updated_at":"2013-10-17t13:00:18z","body":"not an owncloud issue"}]
