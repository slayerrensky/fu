and click end web and this apparently helps to restart/refresh php.ini file, unfortunately didn't work for me.\r\n\r\nthe other thing i would like to point to is that /owncloud/remote.php/core.css this doesn't point to the correct location of core.css, instead gives me this as an output - no input file specified.\r\n\r\nif i go like this however, http://www.bibliostream.com/owncloud/remote.php?core.css it works!\r\n\r\nso maybe my problem is do with owncloud resources? any ideas? i think we're pretty close...\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\njames"}]
