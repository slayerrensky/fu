just upgraded owncloud to version 5.0.8 and i have the same ongoing problem!\r\n\r\nwhen i log in to owncloud i see at the top of the page, a banner saying: \"your storage is full, files can not be updated or synced anymore!\"\r\n\r\nwhen i go to personal there is a message saying: \"you have used 2.1 gb of the available 2.1 gb\".\r\n\r\nthat's completely wrong as currently my server shows:

people are reporting same issues with previous version (i can confirm that problem existed in 5.0.6 and previous) and... no fix, no solution made. come on! i've been trying to use owncloud since version 4. waited till it gets better and when version 5 was released thought - okay finally it is time to try to sync some files - version 5.0.0 - failure, waited bit more - tried to sync 17gb of data, first 2gb were synced and then it stopped. i'd assume this is connected to wrong capacity value.\r\n\r\npersonally, i wouldn't recommend owncloud to anyone. it is to immature product. do not use it!\r\n\r\nit has no file encryption. do you remember that this existed in version 4 and was supposed to be redone in ver. 5. now it is abandon.\r\nissues are reported and then closed and next people report the same issues over and over again.\r\nfor example, a lot of users complained that sync client is syncing files not to root directory but to clientsync folder. new clients are released and you still have to edit configuration file manually.\r\nthere are ongoing syncing problems and they had been advertising this as \"dropbox alternative\". what a joke!\r\ndo you want to have a headache?

seeing strange numbers there... and they also are changing. today when i started the client, it showed something like \"111gb of 541gb\", and now, it shows \"330gb of 748gb\". it's the same as in the personal section, but i wonder what these values should represent. neither 541 nor 748 is the amount of free space on that machine (that would be 419gb only counting the external hard disk always mounted, or approximately 930gb if the nas is up and mounted. also not the total space, that would be 917gb or ~2,8tb in these situations, respectively. so i'm still clueless as to what values it shows... will check if i have some time - can anybody give me a hint where to check how the values are determined, or what they *should* represent?\r\ni would love to be able to close this issue finally...\r\nbut in any case, they are now thank good consistent in client and personal page :).\r\n\r\nedit: am i correct in assuming the  calculation logic for the used space is in the getfileinfo function in lib/files/view.php? and that value seems plausible\r\nwhat seems to be somehow wrong, though, is the second value... but i think i have an idea now. the value contains only the storage of the root folder if i have seen correctly in the code (lib/files/view.php, basicoperation), right? but it indeed is the sum of the free space plus the used space (see lib/helper.php, getstorageinfo).\r\n\r\nso what confused me the whole time basically is that what is shown is the sum of free space and the space used up by *this user*. 419+111 ~=540 (probably i remembered one of those two values incorrectly), and 419+330 ~=748gb. and i thought it was supposed to show the available total space (i.e. the total space that would be available if the hard disk was completely empty).\r\n\r\nso i know now what the values represent. to an end-user these values might make sense, to me as the sole user and system admin i was puzzled... it would  seem more understandable to me if owncloud showed the remaining space instead of this constructed sum.\r\n\r\nwill finally close this issue now, though. thanks for fixing it somewhere in the past ;)"}]
