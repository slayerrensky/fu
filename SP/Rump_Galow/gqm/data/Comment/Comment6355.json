recommends (almost everybody that currently enjoys owncloud 5 stores images, therefore the image thumbnails toolchain should be found in almost every installation), while libreoffice should go to suggests (it's perfectly reasonable to have an owncloud 6 setup without odt thumbnails, because not everyone is going to use odt features, and also because even when using the new owncloud odt edition capabilities, not everyone is willing to install libreoffice dependencies on servers).\r\n\r\nthe problem with the current owncloud 6 packaging is that it is impossible to decide which dependencies are important, provided libreoffice alone brings 150+ lines of dependencies (x libs, gtk, fonts, java, python) that bury in noise all the other recommends lines. to state it clear: which are the soft-dependencies to generate image thumbnails? which are the soft dependencies to generate video thumbnails? are there other recommends soft-dependencies besides the latter two, and libreoffice?\r\n\r\nit would be easier to decide which packages are relevant if libreoffice went in suggest and whatever is needed for images/video went to recommends, because the display of
