was discussing the ux with @jancborchardt at the dev meeting. the dialog was originally removed because the implementation in 4.5 could only handle single files. pressing cancel would only cancel the first file and autorename the remaining files. fixing that properly requires keeping track of the upload queue and actively managing it with the skip / replace / rename options. i assume that is why someone disabled it altogether and always autorenames the files. i already worked on this since last week and it is more complex than it seems.\n\ni have a proper dialog ready but i need to fix a last remaining bug and polish some of the code. pr imminent. hopefully tomorrow.\n\nthe idea is to use a windows 8 like dialog when the versioning app is not available. when it is availabe files will
