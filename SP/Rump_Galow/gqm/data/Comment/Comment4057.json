 you're just speculating, which is a bias opinion.  i'm sure there are various ways to implement the feature that wouldn't be confusing.  \r\n\r\nfor instance, how about adding a checkbox named \"adopt user ownership on new files/folders\".  how about adding an icon to indicate the user is not the owner of file/folder and the permissions are inherited from the shared settings? \r\n\r\nto say that users will get confused it just limiting the software due to lack of understanding how to implement it the right way.  to prevent a user from deleting a file that they create, just because it resides in a shared folder they don't own, makes absolutely no sense.\r\n\r\nlet me ask you this.  can this functionality be added through hooks via a 3rd-party app?
