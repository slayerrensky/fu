a common misunderstanding that databases are fast. most of the time the local filesystem is significantly faster then a database so caching things in a database doesn't always make sense. so it would be great if you could do a brief check of the old and new codepath before merging this. i just commited a small trivial tool that i did years ago to compare the performance of an old and a new codepath. perhaps this is helpful to you.
