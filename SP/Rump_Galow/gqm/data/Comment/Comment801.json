is because of the use of em units in the interface, and they should be changed to px to stay consistent. this is what github does for instance, their interface just doesn’t change when using a different font size. it would be a pain to try to cater to getting the user’s font size, instead we should focus on a great base interface which is scalable via zooming. and since we use a reasonably big base size this should be fine.\r\n\r\ni’ll fix this by changing core.css values from em to px, as previously discussed in a thread on the mailing list. cc
