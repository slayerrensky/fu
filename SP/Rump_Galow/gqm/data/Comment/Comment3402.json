just want to add to this issue, that it is not only a \"cosmetic\" problem, but can lead to serious problems if the log file gets bigger than some limits on the server. i am not sure what the specific limitation is, but in my case, my owncloud installation on a hosted environment got unusable as soon as the log file was 30mb big. after that i only got an  error 500 (internal server error), and could not log in anymore. so, while i agree that it is (in principle) a minor issue with possible workarounds (deleting the log file), it can lead to serious problems (it took me several hours to find the problem)."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/18969989","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/3402#issuecomment-18969989","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/3402","id":18969989,"user":{"login":"karlitschek","id":867445,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/87ce2b4531ee1a0c32b50e0d8f049224?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f06e7098636caebfc9c30c9f52eb905df.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"87ce2b4531ee1a0c32b50e0d8f049224","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek","html_url":"https://github.com/karlitschek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-06-05t11:34:10z","updated_at":"2013-06-05t11:34:10z","body":"i
