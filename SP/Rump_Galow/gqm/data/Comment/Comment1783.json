the trick with the locales did something, but it's still very strange.\r\n\r\nnow, when i rename a file aaa -> ã©aaa, the 'name' field of the fscache table is good.\r\nthat's a nice progress.\r\n\r\nbut, in the webinterface, when i go in the files page, the names are bad (the first char is not showed), but but but.,, the link to access them is good.\r\nso, i see the file aaa, but the link is /?app=files&getfile=download.php?file=/%c3%a9a%c3%a9a\r\n\r\nwhat is more strange is that sometimes after opening a file and then coming back in the files page, the names are good, but not
