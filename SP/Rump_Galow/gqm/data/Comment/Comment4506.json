nice. :+1:   two small remarks. is it possible to disable avatar support with an config.php setting? this would be good if someone doesn't want to provide this for the users. my default picture was a blue square with an f in it. this is great. but the blue doesn't fit the rest of the owncloud interface at all. it's quite ugly actually. can we use a different default color? white, black or
