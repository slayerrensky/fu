i would love if you polished the music app ;) if you need to divert your attention go to the search provider and filter the results. i did not see a reason for the true parameter, but maybe debugging will show the code that need that flag. best solution would be a filter parameter that takes a callback that is used by the mountpoint implementation to filter the results in their search method. or maybe an object that can contain further sql like conditions and even a filter method .... just thinking ... don't know which has the least performance impact. least performance impact should be an additional `and path like 'files%'`. but that would need to be added to the searchbymime as well.\r\n\r\nmaybe the best option is to add an optional $app parameter to the search methods that defaults to 'files' and then use the additional like in the sql. that way the gallery or any arbitrary app is still able to search for files in other apps ... @deepdiver1975 sound reasonable?\r\n\r\ncc
