as i said, can you break the accessibility issues down into specific problems and what you suggest as solutions how we fix it? it would be cool if you can help us! thanks!\r\n\r\nsorry, my knowletge of coding html and javascript  is very basic. ofcourse i can tell you where the problems are, but unfortunatly i can not explain what todo to get them fixed in detail :-(.\r\n\r\nin general there seem to be some elements in the owncloud interface, that are not recognized or marked as  buttons, links, etc. but the screenreader programs for blind people do need that kind of information to deal  with the web interface.  the next problem is, that  the different screenreaders are handling the pages of a web interface in different ways, that means that a problem occures with one screenreader, with another the same problem does not exist but maybe other difficulties are occuring :-(. also the browser might be a reason what is presented correctly or not...\r\n\r\njust to give an example: if i log in the web interface of my owncloud installation with safari on mac os, i  can see the username where to click on to get the personal settings opened. the username isn't presented as a link or a button and i only know that i have to click on it  because a sighted friend tells me to  do so to get the personal settings opened. if i log on my owncloud installation with windows7 and firefox and using jaws as my screenreader, i can't see the username. using windows7 and firefox and the free screenreader nvda everything worked like in mac os, the username is presented but it is not marked as a button or link.\r\n\r\nthe problem with the accessibility isn't very easy and depends on many factors, but in most cases a webpage has not to be fully accessible regarding to the standards or definitions  that can be found in the net for this topic to be useable for blind users.  most times it is ok to take care of some basic things to make a page useable and maybe we should start at this point.\r\n\r\nas already said, i'm not a developer and i do not know what to to in html or javascript to  improve accessibility. but maybe i can ask some people i know that have more knowletge to help. and also maybe the following webpages can give you some tips or hints what needs to be done in detail:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.die-barrierefreie-website.de/umsetzung/index-umsetzung.html\r\nhttp://webdesign.weisshart.de\r\n\r\nif somebody of you lives around munich it is also possible to meet and discuss and demonstrate the different problems.., just let me know if you  are interested :-).\r\n\r\ncheers and kind regards,\r\n\r\n

12. october i'll be not \nin munich :-(. maybe we should exchange phonenumbers / mailaddresses to \nplan a meeting in october an to discus the details?\n\ncheers,\n\n
