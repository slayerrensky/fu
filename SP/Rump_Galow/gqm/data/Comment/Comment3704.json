(to this point i have to tell you, that we only use active directory from microsoft so i only tested it against an ad.)\r\n\r\ni try to illustrate it with some examples.\r\nwe have a logical hierarchical group setting on our ad. i mean with that, we have some ou's wich contain many groups, but the groups are in a logical hierarchical tree through the member and memberof attributes.\r\n\r\nok, i recognized, that the github text-editor has not the possibility to let me paint in ascii art so i made a picture of my ascii painting and i will attach it. :)\r\n\r\n![ad-ascii](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4670324/648395/90ac8f24-d429-11e2-8b8a-336706fadd63.png)\r\n\r\nso, now the examples.\r\n\r\nan employee of our company needs to have the possibility to give some stuff to the teachers of his departments, or the students of his department, or just a single class, or just the students of this class, or just the teachers of this class or just to a single user.\r\n\r\nthe problem was, that a single student isn't allowed to share something with the employee.\r\nthey are also not permitted to share something with all teachers. theyre just allowed to share stuff with they're class they're in.\r\n\r\nso f.e. the employee needs the possibility to share with all students of his department. \r\nthe problem was, that for this we would need to create a group with all students and the employee in it so he could share something with them. \r\nbut at the current security settings of owncloud would make it possible for every student of the department to share with all other students of the departement and with the employee.\r\n\r\nso we decided to create groups with subgroups in it. my extension makes it possible that a user of the top group can share with the users and groups of the subgroups, but not that a user of a subgroup can share with a user of a topgroup or with a topgroup. (see my ascii art for an example preview of the groups \r\n\r\nif you can't handle what i'm trying to tell you let me know, i could create a documentation, wich i'm allowed to handle out to you.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/19389735","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/3704#issuecomment-19389735","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/3704","id":19389735,"user":{"login":"owncloud-bot","id":2709266,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/6e9c466b35bb113112f7401859d614f6?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2ffb9254ba3a207c96653361df97807914.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"6e9c466b35bb113112f7401859d614f6","url":"https://api.github.com/users/owncloud-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owncloud-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owncloud-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owncloud-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owncloud-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owncloud-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owncloud-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owncloud-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owncloud-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owncloud-bot/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-06-13t12:57:05z","updated_at":"2013-06-13t12:57:05z","body":"can one of the admins verify this patch?"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/19393115","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/3704#issuecomment-19393115","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/3704","id":19393115,"user":{"login":"mtrichards","id":1818977,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/a1655fd2e819638708ee854fa941008b?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2fa75d8baded229745ad65d43f7a7975df.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"a1655fd2e819638708ee854fa941008b","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtrichards","html_url":"https://github.com/mtrichards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtrichards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtrichards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtrichards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtrichards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtrichards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtrichards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtrichards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtrichards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtrichards/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-06-13t13:55:07z","updated_at":"2013-06-13t13:55:07z","body":"this is a great explanation, thank you @sennl .
