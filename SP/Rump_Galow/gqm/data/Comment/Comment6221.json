and and thank you for your patch. the patch surely is useful, but i am not sure whether \"we are there yet\" with this patch only. first of all, \"active directory has a search limit of 1000 by default\" is not a property of all ldap servers, so we may want to consider putting this into a subclass for active directory. second, i don't think a getallgroups() function should be added to the public interface, but getgroups() should be fixed to work correctly instead. this may involve adding a protected function that is used by getgroups(), but as it currently is getgroups() is still available with incorrect documentation and not working as expected."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/30205651","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/6221#issuecomment-30205651","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/6221","id":30205651,"user":{"login":"leo-b","id":6097948,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/844a5ac2f89dedf54bb173a0134b7b0f?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f8409df19eb5f9a5705dcc6e9916a867e.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"844a5ac2f89dedf54bb173a0134b7b0f","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leo-b","html_url":"https://github.com/leo-b","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leo-b/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leo-b/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leo-b/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leo-b/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leo-b/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leo-b/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leo-b/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leo-b/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leo-b/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-12-10t07:51:22z","updated_at":"2013-12-10t07:51:22z","body":"this
