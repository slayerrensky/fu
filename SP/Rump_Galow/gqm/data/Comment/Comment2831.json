\r\nwhat you actually can do is to override the login template (core/templates/login.php line 16ff) by theming [1]. admittedly, it is cracking a nut with a sledgehammer (you can also just patch it alternatively), but it works.\r\nagreed, there could be a config switch. we're happy about pull requests ;)\r\n\r\n[1] http://doc.owncloud.org/server/5.0/developer_manual/core/theming.html\r\n\r\np.s.:\r\ni am closing this, as it is not really something to fix/do, besides the last part. this has nothing too do with ldap acutally, so feel free to open it as a new issue.\r\nin case you still have questions regarding 1) or 2), i will answer them here, anyway."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/16314781","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/2831#issuecomment-16314781","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/2831","id":16314781,"user":{"login":"jancborchardt","id":925062,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f84ec51f9ceed468217d4e13abf78da9c.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt","html_url":"https://github.com/jancborchardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-04-12t20:08:02z","updated_at":"2013-04-12t20:08:02z","body":"@raydiation i donâ€™t have any clue about ldap, no need to @ me in issues like these."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/16322734","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/2831#issuecomment-16322734","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/2831","id":16322734,"user":{"login":"raydiation","id":195053,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/aa0d7b7302e0d7f4f9513c23b571383a?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2faf0a25e27510f77d97634a6bbe653b13.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"aa0d7b7302e0d7f4f9513c23b571383a","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation","html_url":"https://github.com/raydiation","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-04-12t23:26:52z","updated_at":"2013-04-12t23:26:52z","body":"@jancborchardt tbh not sure why ive added you :p maybe wrong tab"}]
