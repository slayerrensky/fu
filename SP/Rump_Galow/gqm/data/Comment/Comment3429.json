think i found at least one reason for this to happen. the error occured every time i tried to sync my files, when creating traces with owncloud.exe--logwindow (windows client) it was possible to find the folder the sync stopped.\r\n\r\n05-25 23:43:40:741 oc_module: opendir method called on ownclouds://[servername]/remote.php/webdav/musik/itunes/itunes media/mobile applications\r\n05-25

itunes media/mobile application folder. i had a look at the file timestamps and there were some files with creation dates in 1961. as i didn't want the folder to by synced anyway, i deleted it and everything worked fine. \r\n\r\ni then searched the server log (web interface/administrator panel) for suspicious entrys and found this one:\r\n\r\ndatetime::__construct(): failed to parse time string (-254388498) at position 8 (9): unexpected character at /[pathtoowncloud]/3rdparty/sabre/dav/property/getlastmodified.php#39\r\n\r\nobviously the calculation of the timestamp as suspected earlier has something to do with the error. the timestring found in the log has a negative value, which is caused by the fact that 1961 is before 1970 which marks 0 in linux timestamp (you can proof this by calculating the time from that timestamp without the-, it is 8 years something, so 1970 - 8.something = 1961.something).\r\nit seems that the file getlastmodified.php does not work with negative numbers (although i don't see why with my limited php knowledge   ). \r\n\r\nworkaround (at least for this case): either delete the suspicious folder or check that all file timestamps are newer than 1970. if not, you have to set them manually.\r\ndocfreixenet\r\nnewbie\r\n
