my point of view is the following:\r\n\r\n- the shared folder owes to user1. so the responsability of mantaining this shared folder is of user1. \r\nif she decides to share the folder and let other users to fill up the space of this folder, she should know what is doing. so the filled space must compute to user1's (owner) quota.\r\n\r\n- btw, it would be nice that user1 defines a maximum space for the shared folder as the same way that she can specify an \"expiration date for the sare\". this will let her to have good control over their space.\r\n\r\nfurthermore it would permit the
