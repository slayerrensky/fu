the commit says that file_get_contents will not work but nothing about external storages. i tried it here, but only with the local file system and it works just fine. for the test i just edited a file with the external text editor which executes the encryption proxy which calls file_put_contents on the (etmp|part) file. i think that's the place where something should fail, but maybe only if external storages are used? at the moment i'm struggling in  setting up a webdav mount so i can't test is with an external_storage.\r\n\r\nwe could also add to the file cache .etags beside .part as a second extension which should be ignored by the filecache but than we can use .part right away. and we should definitely ignore this files because otherwise the sync client will also try do download them."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/19540471","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/3732#issuecomment-19540471","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/3732","id":19540471,"user":{"login":"schiesbn","id":1589737,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/8912b598c7b32dd25b87fd168e0b06b2?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f0a323047dbe8329db30eae8dbe96e55e.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"8912b598c7b32dd25b87fd168e0b06b2","url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn","html_url":"https://github.com/schiesbn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-06-17t11:58:46z","updated_at":"2013-06-17t12:25:51z","body":"now i could set up a webdav mount and was able to make some tests. indeed for external storages file_get_content doesn't work. i assume that's because for the file cache these files doesn't exist, but i wonder why it works for the local file system than.\r\n\r\nfurther i did some test with the files app disabled and it seems like sync client uploads to external storages also doesn't work. i'm quite sure that this is the same issue, because the webdav back-end also uses .part files. i opened a separate issue for it: https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/3759"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/26501432","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/3732#issuecomment-26501432","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/3732","id":26501432,"user":{"login":"karlitschek","id":867445,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/87ce2b4531ee1a0c32b50e0d8f049224?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f06e7098636caebfc9c30c9f52eb905df.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"87ce2b4531ee1a0c32b50e0d8f049224","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek","html_url":"https://github.com/karlitschek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-10-17t12:55:07z","updated_at":"2013-10-17t12:55:07z","body":"@schiesbn is this still valid?"}]
