environment values is kind of convoluted, since iis is pretty particular about what environment settings it passes through to cgi apps that it executes.  still, it's possible to configure.  i've put together a short video explaining the process in windows server 2012.  the process should be similar in other recent editions of windows server, although some older versions may have different methods of configuring environment variables for fastcgi processes.\r\n\r\n**video:** http://screencast.com/t/wwpuqkfvfwr2\r\n\r\nnote that early in the video, i execute the command *as the server user*, through the server.  even though (this wasn't shown in the video) there is a global environment variable set on this server for `openssl_conf`, the web server doesn't see/expose that value due to its own security restrictions.\r\n\r\nthere may be ways to pass through this value from the system environment to the web server environment, but this is better, since it could potentially allow you to set different key settings for different hosts on the server, and isolates those environment settings to a single site, limiting cross-site exposure of sensitive environment settings.\r\n\r\nas
