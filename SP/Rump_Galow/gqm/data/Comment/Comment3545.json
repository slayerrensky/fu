i was basically just backing up what @icewind1991 said.\r\n\r\nyou should not assume that the .htaccess can be generated by the php process. an administrator might not allow that for security reasons. and he is spot on, because if the software happens to have a severe bug, the php process could still only write to well-defined data directories instead of the whole source tree that is accessible from the web (assuming the webserver is configured correctly). [write access to the apps is questionable as well, but let's do one thing at a time.]\r\n\r\nfor the same reason it is not a good idea to require being able to write to your own source tree as a software project. i am rather surprised to hear (see https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/3545#issuecomment-18687158) that the data directory is usually generated by the php process (which requires write access to the software root) instead of just shipping the data directory and telling administrators to setup (only) that correctly.\r\n\r\nas for creating the .htaccess: on setup/update rather go through the administrator if you do not have write access to the root, give him a chance to review the content of the .htaccess (e.g. by sending it to him and have him use the local account to place it into the software root).\r\n\r\nas for using the .htaccess to set the max post size: it seems to make sense to explicitly bring these value to the administrators attention. silently writing an .htaccess without letting the admin know has the following problem: you set 512 mb in the hopes to increase the post max size value. but once the .htaccess is in place it seems to be impossible to get the global value. in case an administrator increases the global value to 1024 mb, the htaccess you created will artificially limit the value to 512 mb, which is not what the administrator wants.\r\n\r\nedit: yet, i haven't installed owncloud on apache recently, so do not know how things behave exactly right now. i might give that a try.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/18851530","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/3545#issuecomment-18851530","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/3545","id":18851530,"user":{"login":"vicdeo","id":991300,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/57b8c1e26d502d5414e4b2fb875d2994?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2fe8357fefe8bad5436de368fa5a419461.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"57b8c1e26d502d5414e4b2fb875d2994","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo","html_url":"https://github.com/vicdeo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-06-03t16:02:03z","updated_at":"2013-06-03t16:06:08z","body":"@bantu
