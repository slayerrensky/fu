lib/templates, this takes care of almost all android mobile phones.\r\n(not tablets tho)\r\nalso drop 'n9', just check for 'nokia'\r\nneed to add mini-tablets too.\r\nand the function imagepath should check for (some image) .mobil.jpg, as u have to have other images for mobile devices.\r\n\r\nhave most of jpanelmenu worked into oc 5.0.\r\nwould be nice to set a 'standart' viewport for mobil mode, i use:\r\nmeta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=0.37, maximum-scale=0.37, user-scalable=0\"\r\nand in core/css/styles.mobile.css\r\nset the body font-size to

mostly add images from a mobil phone and not files, also add a < mobil > true / false < /mobile> to info.xml <- calendar would be false as u should use your phones bild in calendar and saves time so u dont have to make a special design for the calendar app, same goes for the files app.  :-)\r\n\r\nedit: adding a dialog.css / dialog.mobile.css would help alot so u dont have to go to styles.css to look for the dialog design.\r\nactually drop dialogs when in mobil mode, using dialogs on a mobil phone is a pain in the a$$, use 'standard' php scripts for most input / edit stuff. mush more easy to design.\r\nedit2: also stop using favicon.png etc. in the core layout; use .ico files insted, that actcully works...
