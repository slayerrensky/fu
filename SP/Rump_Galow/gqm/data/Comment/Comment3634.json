let me quickly explain why i'm crying for the unminified version:\r\nthe basic principle of open source is that one can grab the code and adjust it to his/her needs.\r\nminified javascript does not allow that and is treated as binary delivery.\r\nas soon as we deliver minified javascript be have to deliver the unminified version as well.\r\n\r\nwhere ever we have the unminified version at hand (and the size diff is reasonable) we shall make use of the benefits of minified js.\r\n\r\njquery and jquery-migrate(?) offer that size benefit and use of minified makes sense.\r\nplease re-add them
