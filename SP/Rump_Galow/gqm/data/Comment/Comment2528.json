@icewind1991 you are the authors of the two updaters. since the order of hook execution can vary (depending on the order of the connect calls) the oc\\files\\cache\\shared_updater might scan files the oc\\files\\cache\\updater wants to move. both triggered by a single rename. my feeling is that the oc\\files\\cache\\updater must be executed first, to fix the cache mismatch. the oc\\files\\cache\\shared_updater and also oca\\\\files_versions\\\\hooks should be executed afterwards. it's bad that a specific order is necessary but i don't see many alternatives.\r\n\r\nwebdav is not the only scenario where this might be necessary: refreshing the web ui during a web file upload will cause the file to show up with the wrong file size as well. that might cause the sync client to download a partially uploaded file. i think the cleanest approach would be to mark files being uploaded as 'in progress' in the file cache. i tried a hack where i kept the size at -1 for .part files which worked, but caused the web ui to scan the filesystem over and over again. i could change the js code to ignore .part files as well... but meh.\r\n\r\nanother approach might be to set the size to -2 (*hooray for magic numbers*) to mark .part files as uploads in progress. we could do that in a pre file_put_contents hook and clean it up after the upload. but this would very likely still require
