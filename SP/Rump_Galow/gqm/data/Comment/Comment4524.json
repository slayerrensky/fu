expected."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/23322744","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/4524#issuecomment-23322744","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/4524","id":23322744,"user":{"login":"blizzz","id":2184312,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/1898b25a9cb3aa1a0f0febd1359910b9?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2fca03acec6deadf508b75eb0cf9ba036c.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"1898b25a9cb3aa1a0f0febd1359910b9","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz","html_url":"https://github.com/blizzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blizzz/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-27t09:16:23z","updated_at":"2013-08-27t09:16:23z","body":"oddâ¦
