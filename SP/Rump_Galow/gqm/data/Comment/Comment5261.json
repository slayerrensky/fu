the absolute path to the file. there is no reliable way to obtain this path. oc filesystem has a function getlocalfile() i used it before but after some problems on windows servers @icewind1991 told me that this is not a reliable way to get the absolute path to a file. so it seems that the most reliable way to work accross different server operating systems is to rely on oc filesystem which also
