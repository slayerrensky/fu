exists? this would still allow to place the data dir by accident in location where it wasn't intended. i worry a bit that by creating some \"random\" rules we are trying to be smarter than the admin of the actual system which will fail sooner or later. after all we are talking about a admin setting during installation, a admin can do a lot of dump things. choosing the wrong data dir is the least evil and can be reverted easily \"mv wrongdir rightdir; edit config.php; done\". deleting some additional empty directories is also not a big deal.\r\n\r\nlets see what @jancborchardt think about it
