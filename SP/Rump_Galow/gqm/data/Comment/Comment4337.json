disabling search_lucene but i'm \nstill working through the load process to find where the rewrites affect things. \nthere are a number of changes needed for existing 2.2 sites to work with 2.4, \nincluding permission settings, but the re-writes are the usual problem :( and \nnow the apache list are refusing to help rework the code!\n\n### steps to reproduce\n1. upgrade apache to 2.4 ...\n2.

on to this and i'm finding a difference between two setup's ...\r\non the 'production' backup machine which is used to test prior to upgrading, selecting maintenance mode gives a white screen, but by commenting out the line 45 in templatelayout.php i get a visible page. i've now configured the development system which is a local apache server and eclipse ide and the same fix is not required. the two apache configurations should be clones, but obviously something is different. i still get a white screen for normal access, and i'm just configuring sqlite editor so i can play with the database
