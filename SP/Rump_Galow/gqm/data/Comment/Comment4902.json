are lazy, at least i'm :wink: they will trust themselves that they entered the right password without taking the extra effort using the switch to show the password. also they might just want to try the feature enter something arbitrary and than if the want to switch to a real password they will discover that this is not possible without knowing the old password.\r\n\r\nalso the implications if the admin enters a wrong password are different. during installations there are no users beside the admin, if he discover that the password was wrong he can just start over from scratch (if he is still logged-in he can even change the password without knowing the old one or he can use the password recovery feature if a email address was set). this means some extra work but there will be no harm.\r\non the other hand if he entered a wrong recovery key password (either because he was lazy or because he just wanted to test the feature) it can happen that he will only discover this mistake months later. during this time a lot of files from different users might be encrypted with the recovery key. the only solution for the admin will be: delete the recovery key and edit the database to be able to generate a new recovery key. but this also means that he will no longer be able to recover files which where encrypted with the old recovery key. since this is not a password you use every day the chance is high that you will discover this mistake only at the point where you need to recover some files. but than it will be to late and the data will be lost. we should definitely try to avoid this!\r\n\r\nfor this reasons i think we should take some extra efforts to make sure that the password is really the password the admin wants and that he can remember it and not rely on a switch where we can't control whether it is used or not. also the logic of repeating important passwords is widely used on other web pages. so you could argue that the usefulness of such a behaviour is proven, at least for some use cases and i would say here we have such a case."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/24738502","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/4902#issuecomment-24738502","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/4902","id":24738502,"user":{"login":"bantu","id":189375,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/88483d87947219efecfc570465c753b2?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2fcdc48f189c0e2e8a870f3d54615a2f0d.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"88483d87947219efecfc570465c753b2","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bantu","html_url":"https://github.com/bantu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bantu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bantu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bantu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bantu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bantu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bantu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bantu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bantu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bantu/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-09-19t13:32:04z","updated_at":"2013-09-19t13:32:04z","body":"showpassword.js
