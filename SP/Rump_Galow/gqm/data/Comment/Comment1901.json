raydiation,\r\n\r\nthank you very much for your reply. i know that this basically is an apache problem.\r\n\r\nfirst: owncloud is working. i'can't see any disadvantage while errors occur. if i disable rewriteengine in .htaccess the sync client is not working, so i assume that redirection is working basically.\r\n\r\nsecond: apache and plesk is very tricky, cause all config files are controled by plesk. if you want to modify apache config you have to supply some extra files.\r\n\r\ni put inside this extra file(s): \"+followsymlinks +symlinksifownermatch\" (which was not in plesk original config)\r\n\r\n\r\n<ifmodule mod_fcgid.c>\r\n    <files ~ (\\.php)>\r\n        sethandler fcgid-script\r\n        fcgiwrapper /var/www/cgi-bin/cgi_wrapper/cgi_wrapper .php\r\n        options +followsymlinks +execcgi +symlinksifownermatch\r\n        allow from all\r\n    </files>\r\n</ifmodule>\r\n\r\ndoing that has no (positive) effect on the error log. to be sure i modified the original files directly and restarted only apache (this change will be lost after next modification with plesk), but same game.\r\n\r\nbut back to the error log:\r\n\r\n.... which implies that rewriterule directive is forbidden: /var/www/vhosts/esm.from-de.com/httpdocs/owncloud/index.pl ......\r\n\r\ndid you see that it tries to redirect to index.pl ????\r\n\r\nif i can fix it i'll give feedback immediately, i do my best.........\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nklaus"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/14104510","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/1901#issuecomment-14104510","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/1901","id":14104510,"user":{"login":"raydiation","id":195053,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/aa0d7b7302e0d7f4f9513c23b571383a?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2faf0a25e27510f77d97634a6bbe653b13.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"aa0d7b7302e0d7f4f9513c23b571383a","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation","html_url":"https://github.com/raydiation","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raydiation/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-02-26t10:16:57z","updated_at":"2013-02-26t10:16:57z","body":"something
