accurate.\r\n`generate_random_bytes()` returns a string with the given length (so here 128 chars) using `openssl_random_pseudo_bytes()`.\r\n\r\nlet's rename this function to `generate_random_string()` after merging this.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nfrom a security point of view this should be safe to merge and together with #30 this is a real improvement.\r\n\r\n+1 from
