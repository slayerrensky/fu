names, was not a problem. the drawback is, that filenames with characters not in the choosen encoding can not be scanned and found. as danimo said it is not really a workaround, but it moves the troubles to a region where they don't bother me at the moment. i won't recommend here to use it for you, as it is a really quick and dirty solution and may cause troubles i can't overlook. but for me
