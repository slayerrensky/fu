can report that this behavior may occur due to custom graphics replacing the owncloud logo.\r\n\r\ni ran into this issue yesterday, and was very confused as to why it happened. after attempting to find an answer, the only comment i was able to find was the last comment above about \"layout.user.php\". i compared my current one to the original copy, and the only difference was that i had (using the \"template\" forum posts throughout owncloud's forums) changed the file usage type from .svg to .png. because i'd used tracing in any case, i decided to convert the png to svg, as a trace instead of including background. and once i replaced the original .php files (always make copies!), replacing with my new svg labeled as the original was (logo.svg and logo-wide.svg ... someone needs to update the \"how to\" filename), it all returned to normal.\r\n\r\nfyi, i converted the png for free by doing the following:\r\n1. grabbed the image file i wanted, saved as png\r\n2. using foss paint.net, i resized the image to the specific graphic sizes specified (large icon [logo-wide.svg], 252wx122h; small [logo.svg], 140wx32h).\r\n3. also in paint.net, using the \"magic wand\" tool, i removed the coloring from the background, leaving the (in my case white) lettering almost as tracing. saved, again as png\r\n3. using foss inkscape, opened the png, selecting \"embed\", resized document properties to 140x32, resized image itself to 140x32 (it claims it's 129x39), and saved as svg. ensure the background is set to \"blank\" (checkerboard), not a solid color."}]
