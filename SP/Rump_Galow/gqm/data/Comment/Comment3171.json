guys... so i did a little more checking here in an effort to understand why in my environment this is so unpredictable, and i think i stumbled on the issue... it would appear that the fix for this was put in rather recently, and what was confusing was we saw the correct code in js.js however, when you opened the console during this error it look as though this was not fixed...  what i have done was clear my browser cache (as is seems the browser is caching this js) so if you hit an instance without this fix, then came back to an instance with the patched js you were still getting this issue.  once i cleared my browser cache it seems to have gone away.  as a longer term fix perhaps we block the caching of this js??  this would allow you to bounce from instance to instance and grab the fresh code each time...  anyway, the short term fix i think we need to try and have users flush the browser cache and go from

@jancborchardt i thought so too, in the lab i was able to resolve by flushing the cache, or at least i have not see it since, but the other 2 users are still seeing it despite having flushed the browser cache.  so i think we are back to square one.  is there a chance that the js code is cached anywhere else?  the common thread seems to be this is happening after an upgrade.  i am going to try and reproduce this by installing an old version, logging in and uploading files etc. then processing an upgrade to 4.5.10 and see if it reproduces the problem.  that seems to be my only thought at this point?  what do you guys
