we use here the 4.5.9 version.\r\nit seems we encounter the same problem.\r\nwe accessed samba share via oc.\r\nwhen we want to upload file to the root of the share all was fine.\r\nbut if we attempt to upload file to subdirectory of this share we get a webdav 507 error.\r\n\r\nif i comment the line you modified in the oc5 version i can upload to the subdirectory becaus i'm not test anymore quota so it's a bad solution.\r\n\r\ni'm an oc beginner and it seems the oc 4.5 code is not equal to oc 5 code. the variable seems differents.\r\n\r\ncould you provide the same patch adapted for the 4.5.9 version ?\r\n\r\nregards"}]
