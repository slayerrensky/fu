the problem here is that the mount point for /shared is /. which is correct. but this leads to a \"is_dir()\" call for the root filesystem and since \"/shared\" doesn't exist as a physical directory it returns false. this works for all other mount points (e.g. webdav mounts, etc) since here we create a physical directory for the mount point like we known it from unix file systems. but virtual folders like \"/shared\" needs to be detected explicitly, this is what the patch does. another option would be to create a physical \"/shared\" folder but this may lead to other
