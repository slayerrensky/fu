thanks for catching it!\r\n\r\nno i didn't test it, but this will not work. if a anonymous user uploads a file it is not possible to encrypt it since we don't have a valid encryption key. the upload

and keep a list of all anonymously uploaded files in the database so that they get encrypted after the next log-in of the given user.\r\n2. temporarily encrypt it with the public share-key, store the
