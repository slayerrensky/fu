app:\r\nthe app element (not sure here if *app* is the best name tough) contains information about the installed apps and features of the owncloud instance. there are some \"special\" app elements like the one named *core*. it lists the features of the owncloud core, another example for a special app could be \"syncing\" which contains features for the syncing clients. we also could consider to add another attribute *type* to the app element indicating if its a server component or an supported or 3rdparty app.\r\n\r\nother than the initial proposal here all apps can list features which can contain information for client apps. as an example there is the kraft application which would receive inforamation in which path the kraft documents should be stored on the owncloud. the feature value
