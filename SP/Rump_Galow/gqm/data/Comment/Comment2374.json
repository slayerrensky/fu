issue here getting my foldernames from ldap home folder naming rule. i was first having this issue with caldav, so i was filing an issue here https://github.com/owncloud/apps/issues/781 and describe the how to reproduce it with the calendar app. i'm getting those readdir() and opendir() errors now all the time, so i'm not so sure anymore that this is an calendar related problem.\r\n\r\n### expected behaviour\r\nthe directive maps user folders in data/ to an attribute, in my case the uid. the calendar cache is expected to be in data/$uid/cache/\r\n\r\n### actual behaviour\r\nthe home folder naming rule is breaking internal links. the links passed to the webserver are broken, because there is no folder corresponding to the internal owncloud id but to the uid given in the ldap user home folder naming rule.\r\n\r\n### steps to reproduce\r\n1. authenticate against ldap\r\n2. set home folder naming rule\r\n3. caldav links in the calendar are created with the owncloud id\r\n4. import in an external app e.g. lightning, create and delete some dates\r\n\r\n### server configuration\r\noperating system:\r\ndebian gnu/linux 6.0 (virtualized on openvz)\r\n\r\nweb server: \r\nnginx
