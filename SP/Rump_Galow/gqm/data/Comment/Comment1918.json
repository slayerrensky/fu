there are several admins who can remove apps from apps.owncloud.com. but we only do this in extreme situations because we are agains censorship\r\npossible reasons would be a license violations, proprietary code, a security problem or a copyright problem. i see non of it at the moment. the app seems to be relatively useless to me but this is no a reason the delete code from other

karlitschek:\r\n\r\nit's not about censorship. it's the wish to have a robust and usable oc.\r\n\r\nthe procedure i do (and possible other people ): i see 3rd party app_vnc_zimbra in plugin interface, then a button to enable and i enable it. but it doesn't work, there is no error message. only a broken link as i put in this bug. then i don't know hoy to configure it, or fix it, because there is no documentation. \r\n\r\ni workaround broken link and go to oc forum (app_vnc_zimbra section). there, you can see developers saying: \"write to us\", but they don't put a link nor any public
