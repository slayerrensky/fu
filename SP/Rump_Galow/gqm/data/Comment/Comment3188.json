@disk_free_space($this->datadir.$path);``` line on the lib/files/storage/local.php file with e.g. ```return 5000000000;``` if you have 5 gb of space available. then it actually shows the correct value on the \"personal settings\" page.\r\nbut i don't know if it helps against exceeding the space with versioning or trashing files...\r\ni found this solution here:
