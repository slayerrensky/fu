github's implementation is fine, but i'm not sure it's a good idea to copy them. github is aimed at developers. if you're a developer and can't figure out that your stuff is saved when the focus changes, then you aren't likely to be using github.\r\n\r\nwhat about non-techie users? i assume that those users are a target audience of owncloud, right? i know that if i tried to get my mother to change her email with github's interface, she'd get confused. she'd likely look for a save button, or hit enter. niether of which would work. she might, or might not, click elsewhere on the page to change the focus. she's just as likely to hit reload in order to see if that makes a save button appear, or simply leave the page. thus, the focus is never changed, and her email never gets changed.\r\n\r\nat least, that's what i'm worried about. i could be completely wrong, i'd want to talk to a few non-techie users before i went with the github style ui, though.\r\n\r\nthis initially concerned me a lot because if i succeed in launching owncloud at work, i'd have hundreds of non-techie users on it. but after i posted, i remembered that i would be pulling their email addresses in from ldap. so it would only effect the few non-ldap users i might end up with.\r\n\r\n@jancborchardt on the other hand, we could try something like you suggested... save after a short period of no typing. i still wonder how well non-techie's would deal with that, though. i wonder how many would complain about not having a save button... or it not working in their version of ie... does the
