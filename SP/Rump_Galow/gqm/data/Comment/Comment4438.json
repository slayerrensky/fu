i'm fiddling with owncloud for about three month, now. but uploadling files is a pain in the ass. you can either upload one file at a time by webinterface which is quite a bunch of work if you have hundreds of files in a directory tree, or you can use a webdav mount. but sabredav is slow and unreliable. if you forget to set \"use_locks\" in davfs, you end up with zero-byte files. multi-functions-printers can store scans via smb and ftp, but not via webdav.\r\n\r\npermissions would have to be adjusted by the network filesystem (e.g. user-mapping).\r\n\r\n@realrancor: it can
