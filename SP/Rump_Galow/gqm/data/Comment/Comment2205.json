are merged, see the pull request above.\r\n\r\nyesterday i opened a branch[1] to improve the expire function. basically i will expire old versions before creating a new version. this should make it less likely that we will exceed the available memory, but it is not a 100% solution because of following reasons:\r\n\r\n- a version of the old file will be created right before the file gets updated. that means that we know how much space is needed for the version of the old file but we don't know how large the updated file will be. in most cases you can assume that the updated file will have about the same size but of course there could be also cases where the update is much larger than the current file. right now i assume that the update will be not large than 1.5 times of the current file.\r\n\r\n- if a complete new file gets uploaded we only know that we run out of space if the upload fails. so in this case it is to late to expire versions from other files.\r\n\r\nbasically we have two corner cases: if the file update is much larger than the current version or if we upload a complete new file and run out of memory.\r\n\r\nbut all this are only problems if we are talking about a hard quota (physical disk space). most (i would even say all) multi-user installation use a soft quote, this means that the physical storage is much larger than the quota give to a user. in this case all this is not a problem. we will temporarily overstep the quota during upload and after that versions will get expired until we match the quota again.\r\n\r\ngenerally speaking, if you reach your physical quota you can't expect owncloud to manage all the \"metadata\" (versions, trash, encryption keys, logfiles, thumbnails,...) in a way that you can also use the last bits of your hard disk for your content. at this point you should think about cleaning up your owncloud, ask the admin for more storage, extend your hard disk or whatever.\r\n\r\n[1]
