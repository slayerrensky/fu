think the root problem here is that there are so many potential entry points into the code, ie it's acceptable to reference random .php scripts all around the filesystem?\r\n\r\ni concede less experience with php, but were i writing this in perl/ruby i would have a single entry point into the code, which in turn talks to a \"url router\" and that would then have the job to map urls forward/backward to controller actions.  so the only tiddle-able that i would need is the base-uri and everything else falls out from that\r\n\r\nit seems that perhaps we can get there really easily though:\r\n- map any bare paths to remote.php \r\n- map /public/ to public.php\r\n- make the base uri configurable\r\n\r\nnow we get nice looking urls and most of the guesswork disappears from the
