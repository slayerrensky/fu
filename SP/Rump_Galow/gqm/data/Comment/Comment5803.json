or maybe better \"tmp\"-files just that we don't have to name them \".part\"\r\n\r\nregarding encryption and #5447, the problem was that the encryption app removes the \".part\" extension to get the correct file name to find the right encryption keys. this doesn't work with your patch because removing \".part\" would still not result in the correct file name. in this case we need to remove \".part\" and \"-tranferid\".\r\n\r\nthe general problem i currently see is that the idea was that we no longer need any kind of \".part\" files if we use the flags instead. but this wouldn't be the
