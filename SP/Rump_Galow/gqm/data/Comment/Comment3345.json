almost there now. the files are being created with dots in the expected places and the only apparent problem is that the call to `normalizepath` prepends a `/` character if the path doesn't start with one. `glob` under windows appears to expect absolute paths to start with e.g. `c:` rather than `/c:`.\r\n\r\ni've checked that this is the problem by hacking in\r\n\r\n    if

versions to be found.\r\n\r\ni'm not sure whether the correct solution is to change `normalizepath` (which seems risky) or to have separate path normalisation methods for internal use vs passing
