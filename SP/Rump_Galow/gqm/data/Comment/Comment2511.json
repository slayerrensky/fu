influence: i recognized that oc gets slower and slower. i enabled mysql logging to trace what is going on and run in parallel a tail -f run on owncloud.log respectively a htop.\r\nwhat i have seen is, that when i pressed the install button, you see normal cpu and memory load, peaks of slq statements coming up, but long time (5-10sec) where you see no activity at all. in this time of inactivity, the cpu load is low. after install has finished, and just switching to a application like files or music ect (but nothing has been setup or uploaded = plain oc!!) a screen change as similar behavior as mentioned above. it takes loooong time, and there are really high amounts of sql statements beeing set.\r\ni could imagine, that there is a relationship between this error popping up and the activity
