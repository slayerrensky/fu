addition to the login name. most people prefer a short and easy login name, e.g. \"mtgap\" but to other users in mails etc. they want to have their full name, e.g. \"prof. dr. dipl.ing jon van foo-bar-foobar\". this is what the display name provides. maybe in later versions we can allow login with the display name too. but i don't know if many people want to use their full name, like the example above for log in. allowing login with display and user name will also block a lot more possible names because than all display names and all usernames across all back-ends has to be unique."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/12882549","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/1360#issuecomment-12882549","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/1360","id":12882549,"user":{"login":"deepdiver1975","id":1005065,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/bdba071ed68da9ce8edae53c364902ef?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f67e101ad9531b7d25697b76e503e062e.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"bdba071ed68da9ce8edae53c364902ef","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975","html_url":"https://github.com/deepdiver1975","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-01-30t10:06:52z","updated_at":"2013-01-30t10:06:52z","body":"the
