may have not been what i first suspected.  after working with this issue i'm left wondering how owncloud handles a merge when folder names match but in a different case.\r\n\r\nmy problems above seem to stem from the theory of a deadman directory name being \"theory of a deadman\" on one client while \"theory of a deadman\" on another.\r\n\r\ni also have a similar issue with another itunes directory name called on one client \"puddle of mudd\" and \"puddle of mudd\" on another.\r\n\r\nthe difference of case seems to confuse the service resulting in empty directories and failed

the server.\r\nthen the sync came and removed `gulliver` from my client! whoops. all gone.\r\n\r\nmy analysis is that for some reason the owncloud-client did not recognize the uppercase name `gulliver` directory on the server and created a new one with a lowercase name. it kept `gulliver` on the client machine insync with `gulliver` on the server. \r\n\r\nthis is nasty.\r\n\r\nthanks"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/14160815","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/1008#issuecomment-14160815","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/1008","id":14160815,"user":{"login":"danimo","id":1315934,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/9467db6bbeaac42484603e0788aec39d?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f296ab09e5a31dcf357f4d4784453db99.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"9467db6bbeaac42484603e0788aec39d","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danimo","html_url":"https://github.com/danimo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danimo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danimo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danimo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danimo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danimo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danimo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danimo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danimo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danimo/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-02-27t07:35:34z","updated_at":"2013-02-27t07:35:34z","body":"there
