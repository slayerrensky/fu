associated with the actual files. you 'remove' them by removing the associated visible files, i.e. the mac finder / filesystem handles it. if you're not on a mac, this doesn't affect you.\r\n\r\n> afaik mac os is duplicating the files in the .ds - right?\r\n> there is some impact on quota as well.\r\n> \r\n\r\nno, incorrect. mac files are composed of two components, files and resource forks. the resource forks are covered in the .ds components. this configuration has been around for nearly 30 years, so this isn't technically something new.\r\n\r\nthere is also a new file type, known as a 'package' file (.dmg or .pkg) which are seen by the file system as a folder, containing all related assets. this was the new, modern way of handling the resource fork issues in a manner that works across platforms, and is not impactful. \r\n\r\nthe key to understand this is to treat folders with the extension .pkg as a file, not a folder."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/23570944","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/4369#issuecomment-23570944","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/4369","id":23570944,"user":{"login":"daveish","id":3630096,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/579df5d08a41e191df54c872feba9bda?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2fe040561eeb585094ba0476f17bdd3482.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"579df5d08a41e191df54c872feba9bda","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveish","html_url":"https://github.com/daveish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daveish/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-30t15:55:49z","updated_at":"2013-08-30t15:55:49z","body":"i
