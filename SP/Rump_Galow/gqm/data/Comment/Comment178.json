about that, but i am afraid that i do not have the time to really think into that stuff again right now. \r\n\r\nbut one remark from my side: \r\nwhen changing the original approach towards 'my' implementation i left the idea of fast expiring tokens unchanged, though they obviously are a source of unconvenience. the reason was simply that i was told that this is important for security. i have far to little experience to verify that statement myself, though. if that paradigm can be dropped i see a big advantage of the current changes, since they make refreshing the tokens obsolete.
