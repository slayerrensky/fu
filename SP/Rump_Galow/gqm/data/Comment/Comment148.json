used a copy of my productive database but not my data directory (meaning fscache and filesystem were out of sync). after first server start, the clientsync directory was created; then on the server the clientsync directory showed up, with the content as in my productive environment (the files not being available of course, though). so i removed and recreated the clientsync directory (while the client was not running). starting the client again it uploaded the one text file it had in its clientsync directory - and now it seems to be caught in an endless loop, saying over and over again that it can't find the files which never existed on the filesystem in the first place - and neither removing the fscache entries nor removing the csync cache manually (not much experience with the latter, maybe i didn't get the right one) seems to help. amittedly, that's not a usual situation to be encountered, but a neverending loop is never good in my opinion. any idea on how i can fix that? should i
