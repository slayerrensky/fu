as far as i remember, i never had to configure php and webserver (to which i have no access since i'm on a shared hosting) prior to oc6. this seems to be a bug that is treating the limit set for the upload via webui (server side configuration) as the limit for the upload via desktop client. i don't think the server side configuration was intended to function that way."}]
