actually, i was astonished how unbroken the dialog is in ie8. the missing size and date labels cannot be fixed, because ie8 does not support the file api that is necessary for it. so i had to add some checks to only show them when they were available. the only other ie8 hack i had to use is a smaller css width for the 'existing file' divs due to the scrollbars. the previews don't seem to load the first time the dialog is shown, maybe @georgehrke has a clue about this from testing oc/preview with
