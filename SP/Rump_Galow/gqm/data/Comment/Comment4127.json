what has been said here, i am not sure this is clear to everyone: the authentication dialog is created by xcache directly when owncloud tries to purge the xcache variable/data cache. i.e. it is not directly created by owncloud and there is basically nothing owncloud can do to prevent the auth dialog from showing up. your admins have to configure a user/password for xcache-admin (check the php
