for writing on a closed issue, but i am facing the same problem as @sint and this issue seems to be closed without a solution. or am i wrong?\r\n\r\nthe files handled by remote.php are getting compressed twice and render owncloud unusable. i did not get  the point why the content is send back compressed to the client inside remote.php as this is the job of the webserver.\r\n\r\nanyway i came up with a solution useful for all poor souls affected by this \"feature\". to prevent files getting compress twice add these two line to your apache configuration:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsetenvif request_uri \"\\.css\" oc_remote\r\nrequestheader unset accept-encoding env=oc_remote\r\n```\r\n\r\n"}]
