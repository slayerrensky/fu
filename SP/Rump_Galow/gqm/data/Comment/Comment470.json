continues to be a problem. here it is from bug genie:\r\nhttp://bugs.owncloud.org/thebuggenie/owncloud/issues/oc-1580\r\n\r\nthis is repeatable in owncloud 4.5 daily dec 13, and 1.2.0 pre. essentially kill the sync client in the middle of syncing of a large file, and this happens again.\r\n\r\ndescription:\r\nhello,\r\n\r\ni've started syncing an huge folder (w/ subfolders) approx 9gb from mac osx to linux systems (with latest releases on both sides, 1.0.5 and 4.0.7 respectively).\r\n\r\nit took multiple days, and the connection was broken by both network issues and client system shutdown.\r\n\r\nanytime i shutdown the mac osx i needed to manually delete the .csync/lock file inside the $home, and the syncro started again.\r\n\r\ni point out that that folder was syncing only on this client system, and on the web gui it was just browsed by me with no write at all.\r\n\r\nafter the end of the sync, the client started syncing back some files, namely the file that were corrupted by lost connections, believing that those file were newer than the local one.\r\n\r\nthis is not correct, since this caused data corruption (i lost something like a dozen of photos, i hope i still have the camera memory card..).\r\n\r\nin my opinion an incomplete file shall not be submitted to the filesystem to avoid such an issue, or must have a different temporary name (with some exclusion rule). another recipe might be that the timestamp for the incomplete file should be very far in the past (epoch time, for instance), so the sync algorithm won't overwrite the client side (it will just sync if the file is missing) and when the \"original\" poster appear again, it will overwrite the server incomplete file with the complete version.\r\n\r\nas a side note, versioning will not save from data loss, since the server just have the broken file on initial sync.\r\n\r\nthanks again for your efforts and have a nice day. andrea\r\n\r\nreproduction steps:\r\nstart syncing a folder with a lot of medium sized file (depending on network speed, it might be 5-10mb files).\r\n\r\ninterrupt network flow (kill client program, disconnect network on client side, shutdown the client system).\r\n\r\nrestart network flow\r\n\r\nwait for the client->server sync end and look for the server->client sync.\r\n\r\nthe latter will overwrite some files (the file that were on the wire during interruption), believing they are newer than the client local version.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/11355693","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/470#issuecomment-11355693","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/470","id":11355693,"user":{"login":"icewind1991","id":1283854,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/7c20f90ca5df67dd2cad22a8e2f80d8f?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2fc818423776eba38604496a7caddc0251.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"7c20f90ca5df67dd2cad22a8e2f80d8f","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icewind1991","html_url":"https://github.com/icewind1991","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icewind1991/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icewind1991/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icewind1991/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icewind1991/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icewind1991/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icewind1991/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icewind1991/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icewind1991/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icewind1991/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-12-13t22:05:34z","updated_at":"2012-12-13t22:05:34z","body":"i
