\"org.jivesoftware.openfire.ldap.ldapgroupprovider\".\r\nldap.groupnamefield ** -- the field name that the groupname lookups will be performed on. if this property is not set, the default value is cn.\r\nldap.groupmemberfield -- the field name that holds the members in a group. if this property is not set, the default value is member.\r\nldap.groupdescriptionfield -- the field name that holds the description a group. if this property is not set, the default value is description.\r\nldap.posixmode ** -- a value of \"true\" means that users are stored within the group by their user name alone. a value of \"false\" means that users are stored by their entire dn within the group. if this property is not set, the default value is false. the posix mode must be set correctly for your

default filter when loading groups. the default group search filter is created using the attribute specified by ldap.groupnamefield. for example, if the group name field is \"cn\", then the default group search filter would be \"(cn={0})\" where {0} is dynamically replaced with the group name being searched for.\r\n\r\nthe most common usage of a search filter is to limit the entries that are groups based on objectclass. for example, a reasonable search filter for a default active directory installation is \"(objectclass=group)\". when combined with the default filter, the actual search executed would be
