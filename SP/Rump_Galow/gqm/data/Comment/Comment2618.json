way to show only one message per dependency. i imagine an additional backend property \"system_dependencies\" that contains a list of predefined dependencies (currently smb, ftp and curl). this way, only one message per dependency could be displayed. this approach, however, would not work for any other dependencies that are not predefined.\r\nany thoughts about this?"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/18686060","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/2618#issuecomment-18686060","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/2618","id":18686060,"user":{"login":"mtgap","id":1097106,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/454a73ee5feeb428d0c163a48903332c?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f52d29a66f285a1d61125dd69ac0766b2.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"454a73ee5feeb428d0c163a48903332c","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap","html_url":"https://github.com/mtgap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-05-30t15:03:40z","updated_at":"2013-05-30t15:03:40z","body":"you

bad will happen so just change it to 'note'."}]
