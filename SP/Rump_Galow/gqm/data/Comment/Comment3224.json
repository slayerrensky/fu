my way here while searching google for a way to force a default value in the expiration date for links. it looks like this is planned, but not in place yet. for anyone else who may stumble upon this, i've got a fairly simple solution which worked for me.\r\n\r\nin /core/js/share.js (copied to my theme folder of course) in the change handler for the link checkbox, i added this code.\r\n\r\n    // force expiry\r\n    var fortnightaway = new date(+new date + 12096e5);\r\n    oc.share.showexpirationdate([\r\n        fortnightaway.getdate(),\r\n        fortnightaway.getmonth()+1,\r\n        fortnightaway.getfullyear()].join('-')\r\n    );\r\n\r\n    // trigger the change handler to save this expiration date.\r\n    $(document).find('#dropdown #expirationdate').change();\r\n\r\nwhat this does is when they initially click the \"share link\" box, it will automatically check the expires box, and set a date 2 weeks in the future. this encourages use of this feature, while allowing users to still uncheck it if needed.\r\n\r\n(the handler is around line 540 `$(document).on('change', '#dropdown #linkcheckbox', function() {`)\r\n\r\n"}]
