(it is important to note that if anyone is getting this error, your file reads something like \r\n\r\nshm_size = 30\r\n\r\nbut you need to add m of g to the end\r\n\r\nshm_size = 30 m\r\n\r\nbut be sure to put it in quotes or it won't work\r\n\r\nshm_size = \"30 m\"\r\n\r\nand that's that! thanks for getting back to me on this!"}]
