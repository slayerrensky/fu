you only see it when you click the relevant checkbox\r\n\r\n@klugmario that’s exactly what i mean. it will add yet another checkbox to a bloated dialog. but it’s not only about the checkbox, it’s about the fundamental problem we have with feature bloat: before adding more features to the sharing dialog (or anywhere else in owncloud) i would really like to hear the use cases for this.\r\n\r\ni saw what is included, and that’s why i wonder. i share a file/folder with someone, put in their email or username. or i give them a public link. the only use case i see for adding this would be if the person i want to share this file with:\r\n\r\n* stands right next to me\r\n* and has a smartphone\r\n* and has a qr code reader (and knows it)\r\n* and can be bothered to scan the code to get the file\r\n\r\nwhere instead i could just put in their email address, which works more universally and does not require any more options to be added. (see #3224 design forward: sharing dialog.)\r\n\r\nsharing should become less visible, not more. there’s a reason that facebook, dropbox, google drive etc. don’t have something like this implemented: it’s most probably because it’s faster by other means, because few people know what qr codes are and even less people can be bothered to scan them.\r\n\r\nhope that clears up my skepticism towards this."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/29074127","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/5277#issuecomment-29074127","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/5277","id":29074127,"user":{"login":"klugmario","id":5655786,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/7b5ebe4795f9610a075d569495128092?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f5f6bd39e49774659e0f63dc5c076126d.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"7b5ebe4795f9610a075d569495128092","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klugmario","html_url":"https://github.com/klugmario","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klugmario/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klugmario/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klugmario/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klugmario/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klugmario/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klugmario/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klugmario/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klugmario/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klugmario/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-11-22t14:02:23z","updated_at":"2013-11-22t14:02:23z","body":"thank you @jancborchardt, now i understand your point of view.\r\nit's no problem for me if it get's not merged but unfortunately i actually have no time to write this app. i've noted it and will do it anytime in the future."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/29075209","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/5277#issuecomment-29075209","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/5277","id":29075209,"user":{"login":"jancborchardt","id":925062,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f84ec51f9ceed468217d4e13abf78da9c.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt","html_url":"https://github.com/jancborchardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-11-22t14:18:26z","updated_at":"2013-11-22t14:18:26z","body":"@klugmario ok, thanks.\r\n\r\nwhat do you think @karlitschek @kabum @wikinaut @kondou-ger? see my comment above."}]
