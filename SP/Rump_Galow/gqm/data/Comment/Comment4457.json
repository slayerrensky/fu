just tried to reproduce it. i had three users (user1, user2 and user3). folder was shared from user1 to user2 and user3 via group \"users\" after encryption was initialized for all users (user needs to be generated either with the owncloud user back-end while encryption is enabled or every user needs to log-in at least once after the encryption app was enabled). if sharing works all pre-conditions should be met. make sure that the group has edit rights for the shared folder.\r\n\r\ni started two sync clients, one for user2 and one for user3. both sync the folder shared/upload_here. user2 uploads a file. all share keys and filekeys are generated in user1 data directory for the file. we need:\r\n- user1/files/upload_here/file\r\n-

or a complete fresh owncloud installation to make sure that no old conflict files exists from previous tries. alternatively look at the data dirs of the users and remove all leftovers from previous
