big problem is no human can read it.  we just need a timestamp humans can understand.  @emerzh above was a good idea (maybe a really strict format like iso 8601 ( 1977-04-22t01:00:00 )).  truly anything would be better than the unix seconds mechanism.  we even convert it in the web ui.  lots of users complain about it to me.  what i don't know is how deep a change needs to be to adjust that part, so i can't judge if this is difficult or
