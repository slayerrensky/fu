enable encryption app\r\n7. login as \"user1\" (keys will be generated and files will get encrypted, except for \"test.txt\" for \"user2\", since the key of \"user2\" doesn't exist yet)\r\n8. login as \"user2\" (keys will be generated for \"user2\")\r\n9. edit \"/shared/test.txt\", see the encrypted content\r\n10. login as \"user1\"\r\n11. login as \"user2\"\r\n12. edit

editing \"test.txt\" and modifying the content and saving (might be done by mistake). then if you open it as \"user1\" it's the same \"garbage\" as \"user2\" saw in the text editor. would it be
