the perfect world it would be ideal if the guy who loses could get a conflict file back locally. because this is the normal semantics when syncs are done in order on the same file from two different clients. so the behaviour of the system would/should not depend on timing of parallel sync sessions.\r\n\r\nnot sure if this is possible though in the current architecture (would need to throw away the uploaded file and rely on the client to detect a conflict next time round).\r\n\r\nyes, the issue exists for chunked and non-chunked files.\r\n\r\nthanks for looking into this.\r\n\r\nmy
