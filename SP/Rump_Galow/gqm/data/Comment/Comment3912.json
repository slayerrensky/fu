thanks. i know about these articles, but in practice ids are much less complicated. it’s way simpler to use the same selector for css and js – you’ll likely end up with id and class being the same anyway. and i think ids more help than cause specifity issues. and lastly, they establish a hierarchy: ids are major, classes are minor elements.\r\n\r\nalso, i just saw that lots of the changes are just indentation changes. these are intentional, to make the nesting
