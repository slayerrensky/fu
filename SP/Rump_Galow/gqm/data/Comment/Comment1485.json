grepped a bit through the code.\r\n\r\nthe sharing app seems to uses gethome() like suggested by @georgehrke and uses it to mount the home to datadir/userid, see:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/owncloud/core/blob/stable45/apps/files_sharing/lib/sharedstorage.php#l81\r\n\r\nbut there are also apps which uses gethome() directly:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/owncloud/core/blob/stable45/apps/files_external/lib/config.php#l229\r\n\r\nthe drawback if you use gethome() directly is that you end up with a absolute path which might be outside of the data folder. this means that you can't get a oc\\files\\view() for it. all apps i found which uses gethome() directly does only small file operations like reading a config file and always uses default php functions for it.\r\n\r\nbut this can't be the general solution since if you do more advanced file operations you want to use a oc\\files\\view with all it additional features.\r\n\r\nthis would mean that the correct solution is to mount the home always to datadir/userid, which leads to the final questions: \r\n\r\n- can i assume that this mounting happens during login automatically or do i have to do it manually in my app every time before i access the users home folder?\r\n\r\n- what happens if i want to access a folder from a different user, for example if i edit a shared file and want to write the version to the owners folder? i think in this case i should always perform a mount similar to the example in the sharing app above before writing the file to the owners folder.\r\n\r\n@georgehrke @blizzz can we agree on this? if yes, what are the final answers to the remaining
