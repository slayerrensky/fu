save doc.\r\n * first time the doc is saved, libreoffice throws an error:\r\n  error saving the document <document name>: error transferring data to the internet. server error message: 400 bad request.\r\n * if i save again, the document is saved as an odt. if i just close, the document is permanently deleted from google drive.\r\n\r\nserver:\r\n* ubuntu 12.04\r\n* owncloud 5.0.11\r\ndesktop:\r\n* ubuntu 12.04\r\n\r\nis it even possible to edit a google docs file locally and have it saved on google drive in google's format? if it isn't, then can you force webdav and the sync client to treat google drive files as read only?
