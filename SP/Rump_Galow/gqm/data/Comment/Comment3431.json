more information, the way owncloud parses `accept-language` still has issues before #3837 .\r\neven with the fix of #1328 , owncloud still couldn't handle firefox's `zh-tw` (with lowercase `tw`, it would fallback to `zh`) correctly in my test case, it it not fully rfc compliant, that's why i decided to rewrite l10n.\r\n\r\nbefore doing any language detection tests:\r\nsince browsers still may have different language peferrence settings from the os, **i suggest checking browser language peferrences** , which decides `accept-language` header. owncloud does autodetection based on this header.
