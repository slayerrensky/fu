was going to submit a separate bug report, but it is possible this has to do with folder names ending with a space.  while i cannot describe all of the symptoms, syncs with the mac client seem to fail frequently when folders ending with spaces are used.  if all syncs are turned off, both server and clients are all cleaned up, this work again, and only changes were to remove trailing spaces from folder names.  if you look at the mysql show of oc_filecache above, the file id #85656 has a trailing space (see the two spaces to the column separator, rather than one?)"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/28972422","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/3864#issuecomment-28972422","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/3864","id":28972422,"user":{"login":"pvince81","id":277525,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/e446b529679416eb70eafb4ca4da5bbe?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f89d7c394e6dcdf87a91c75ac3b2ccbe8.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"e446b529679416eb70eafb4ca4da5bbe","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvince81","html_url":"https://github.com/pvince81","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvince81/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvince81/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvince81/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvince81/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvince81/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvince81/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvince81/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvince81/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvince81/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-11-21t10:21:31z","updated_at":"2013-11-21t10:21:31z","body":"@meadboater from what i read here https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/5714 it seems spaces issues should be fixed in recent versions: sync client 1.4.2 and oc 6 beta 5.\r\nyou can have a try with 5.0.13 as well.\r\n\r\nsince this ticket is old and probably fixed, i'm going to close it now.\r\nif the issue still occurs for you with recent versions, feel free to reopen :smile: \r\nthanks."}]
