there is the business side of owncloud which requires this to get going.\r\n\r\nin such situations we need to apply exceptions to the general rule: only backport bug fixes.\r\nwe did such efforts in the past as well - it is working out quite well - and at the end people don't cry if there are new  features being added to the release version.\r\n\r\none could argue now that we should increase the
