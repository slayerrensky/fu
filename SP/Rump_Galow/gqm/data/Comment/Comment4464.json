understand, however the feature description for \"themeing\" on the page http://owncloud.org/features/ is quite misleading then. there it says \"... make owncloud look and feel like the rest of your site ...\" and \"... any style or image you place in this directory will be used in place of standard ...\".\r\n\r\nmy understanding of this feature description was (as outlined in the first post of this issue), that e.g. styles.css in my theme directory will be used \"in place of\" (i.e. replacing) the standard file. what is actually true about themeing is, you can modify the existing theme but making owncloud \"look and feel like the rest of your site\" is not possible with the current way themeing is implemented.\r\n\r\nthank you however, for pointing out where to find the relevant code bits to change this :-). i can work with this."}]
