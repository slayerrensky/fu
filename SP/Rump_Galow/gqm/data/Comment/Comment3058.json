i like the idea. however there are some corner cases which are not that easy to solve:\r\n\r\nfor single share files:\r\n\r\n- the trash bin app would need to remember all recipients of the file to restore the share relation again if the file gets restored\r\n- what do we do when a dir above the file was shared to other users or even groups? do we also remember this shares and recreate it explicitly again if a file gets restored? what happens to groups if members entered/leaved the group in between?\r\n\r\nfor files in a shared folder:\r\n\r\n- what do we do if the folder no longer exists, the permission changed etc?\r\n- if the folder was renamed should the trash bins also track this renames to be able to restore the files again for everyone?\r\n- if the folder (and all folder above) get unshared or shared to additional users/groups do we also have to update all trash bins with the stored share relations? this operation can happen by various users (re-shares) and it is possible that the folders/files have different names for different users.\r\n- additionally we would need to remember and restore the recipients of the given file like for single shared files.\r\n\r\nthat's just some thoughts. i'm sure we will find more corner cases if we think about it in more detail. this will become even more complex if server side file encryption is in place. because than we also have to remember all the share keys, maybe even update them etc.\r\n\r\ni think the quite simple but easy to understand solution we have today is at least predicable:\r\n\r\n- if a user deletes a file than he can restore it.\r\n- if possible the file gets restored to the same location again (in case of a shared folder this means that all other people will have access to the file again), if not it gets restored to the users root folder.\r\n\r\nof course i will not stop anyone if he wants to improve the trash bin with respect to shared files. but it is probably not that easy than it looks at the

learn what are the most missing features.\r\n\r\njust a short note regarding the comparison between dropbox and google drive. we have to keep in mind that some stuff is much easier for them than it is for us. dropbox and google runs on their own server and they can decide which web server, database, storage, etc they use and than put their focus on it. on the other hand owncloud doesn't provide a single service but want to empower you to retain control over your data. but this means that owncloud need to work an various different set-ups (operating systems, databases, web servers,...) and support different storages like i tried to explain with respect to the trash bin issue. this shouldn't be an excuse, i completely agree that there is room for improvement. but we have to keep all owncloud components in mind and try to find a solution which works for all of them."}]
