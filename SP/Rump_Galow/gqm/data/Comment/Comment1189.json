just posted this comment to issue #408  but i think it's related to your bug report here. i'll just paste what i wrote below. your symptoms are pretty similar to mine. \r\n\r\n\"   i've been trying to install owncloud 5.0.7 on an ubuntu 12.04 system. i had the problem of double compression causing remote.php to produce css+js files with garbage content. i've finally successfully generated these files using this bit of code as a guide. sadly, the code doesn't seem to do anything on my system. \r\n\r\n   as i mentioned i'm running ubuntu, but nginx is my webserver. i'm also using php5-fpm to serve .php files. \r\ni believe php5-fpm having separate configuration files from cli php lead to my problem. \r\ni suspect this bit of code targets only cli php because by making the change ```zlib.output_compression off``` in /etc/php5/fpm/php.ini file directly i was able to get the webpage looking properly again. \r\n\r\n   if there's anything else i could do to help, just let me know.\""}]
