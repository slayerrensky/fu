real problem is that configuring open_basedir has the effect that curl does not follow redirects anymore. the solution is to follow those redirects manually while making sure there are no redirect loops. such a function has already been documented in the php documentation and is called curl_exec_follow (click on the link in bartv2's initial report of the issue).\r\n\r\nyour patch only moves
