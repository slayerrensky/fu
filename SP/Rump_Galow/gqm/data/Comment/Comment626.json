closing this issue because it has been inactive for a few months. this probably means it’s not reproducible or it has been fixed in a newer version.\r\n\r\nplease reopen if the error still persists with the [latest stable version](http://owncloud.org/install/) (currently owncloud 5.0.9) and then please use the [issue template](https://raw.github.com/owncloud/core/master/issue_template.md). you an also contribute directly by providing a patch – see the [developer manual](http://doc.owncloud.org/server/5.0/developer_manual/). :)\r\n\r\nthank you!"}]
