my experience clients kinda suck at this; i've definitely seen clients simply 'give up' and never sync again after a 503 or 502.\r\n\r\n503 would indeed be the most appropriate for this case though. feel free to send a pr for a new exception :) \r\n\r\nmy theory is that the best way to handle downtime, is to 'black hole' the tcp port. clients _may_ respond better to this, because they'll time-out. this case (i feel) is something that's more likely tested and handled by clients to deal with for example crappy wifi. but i've not tested this :)\r\n\r\nnote that simply turning off the
