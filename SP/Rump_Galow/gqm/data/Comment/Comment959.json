issue in linux it seems.  so the bug seems to be related at least.  i read it generally, but i didn't consider it the same since my issue resulted in data loss (on the client), which quite frankly is a different level of concern for users.  it appears to affect all users with oc server on windows.\r\n\r\nand i just realized another risk from a quick test.  it seems that if you modify the affected file it won't necessarily match the previous one on the server, so a 2nd file is created on the server.  :o\r\n  i didn't wait long enough, but i suspect that 2nd file might sync back down to the
