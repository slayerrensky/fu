don't understand the problems, the files_sharing app is an core app so it's easy to add here the additional settings for personal directly in the apps folder? look some users share 10 - 20 folders for users and guest so he looses control which folders and files are shared. so it make  sense you have an overview in the personal settings and in this overview i would implement the feature del shares,
