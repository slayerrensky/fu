ldap backend does not know, whether a login name clashes with a local user, because the ldap login name (or login names, which is also possible) depend on the configuration and thus can be changed anytime, too.\r\n\r\nwhat is done is that the usernames are unique. this is why local jsmith does not see the data of ldap jsmith.\r\n\r\nso, if there is a local user with the same login as an ldap
