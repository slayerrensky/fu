avatar. this looks totally alien in the interface and attracts the attention from the user away from the content. the colours are no used in the interface anywhere alse and don't even belong to the same colour familiy as the other colours. i showed that to a few people and most think that this looks like an error in owncloud because it looks so different than the rest.\r\n \r\ni think we should:\r\noption 1: don't show the avatar there in the header until the user picked a real picture.\r\noption 2: go with a standard neutral user icon there until the user pics a real one.\r\noption 3: only use more neutral colours for the background like shades of grey or shades of dark
