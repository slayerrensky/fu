we agree on two groups of apps:\r\n\r\n##### *viewers* and *editors*\r\n* text editor,\r\n* pdf viewer,\r\n* slideshow (currently part of pictures) provides the deprecated image viewer app\r\n* video viewer (haven't had a look at the code)\r\n* webodf editor\r\n\r\nviewers and editors provide a meaningful way to interact with a single file. it does not matter if you open a picture from the files or from the pictures app. it will always open in the slideshow, allowing you to go to the next or previous image in the album or in the folder. \r\n\r\n##### *file based apps* providing a specialized focus on a set of files (and folders)\r\n* files (default dir is /)\r\n* pictures (default dir is /pictures) - currently also contains the slideshow / image view functionality used in files,\r\n* videos (default dir is /videos) - haven't seen the code but i think it should work similar to pictures / music, exposing meta information in a music like interface and providing the actual video viewer\r\n* documents (default dir is /documents).\r\n\r\nreal *file based apps* change the visible content to focus on a specific task. the music app works on extracted meta data from audio files and hides all other files. the pictures app shows thumbnails and hides all files but images. each of these apps allows users to upload or if possible to create a new file in the default dir. if the app allows navigation to other folders (files, pictures) it will upload to the current folder. music works on metadata and always uploads to music. videos tbd?\r\n\r\n##### context for a user who wants to share sth.\r\nas @jancborchardt already correctly explained to most of us we want a share button in every viewer & editor, so a user can share what he is currently seeing. we also want a share button in every file based app to allow sharing groups of files / folders.\r\n\r\n##### context for users accessing sth shared with them\r\ni hope we can all agree that users should be able to use any editor & viewer we have to access a file. they should also be able to use any file based app we have to change focus. my gf will kill me if she has to download a full album when she only wants two images in an album of 1k files (we have friends uploading too many bad and redundant holiday pictures, although there is always right click -> download ... ). when i share a project folder (summer holiday 2013) that contains images, documents, music and videos i want to be able to switch apps.\r\n\r\nstarting in the app from which a set of files was shared does not change that."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/26319775","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/4437#issuecomment-26319775","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/4437","id":26319775,"user":{"login":"pvince81","id":277525,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/e446b529679416eb70eafb4ca4da5bbe?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f89d7c394e6dcdf87a91c75ac3b2ccbe8.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"e446b529679416eb70eafb4ca4da5bbe","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvince81","html_url":"https://github.com/pvince81","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvince81/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvince81/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvince81/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvince81/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvince81/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvince81/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvince81/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvince81/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvince81/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-10-15t09:14:20z","updated_at":"2013-10-15t09:14:20z","body":"linking
