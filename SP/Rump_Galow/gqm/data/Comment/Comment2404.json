guys, i'm new in github and just signed up to comment this issue because i used a workaround dealing with this. i hope this works for you too.\r\ni manage a owncloud installation (version 5.0.7) for a small company, we use this as file repository for bigger projects. in one of our projects we have more than 100 users organized in majorly two user groups. one of the users shares a folder with both groups. we faced the problem, that someone synchronized \"wrong\" folders via the desktop sync client (majorly windows, versions 1.2.5 and 1.3.0), then deleted them and the folders, without the files within, remained because any client synchronized the folders again and again.\r\n\r\nthe following procedure helped us to fix this problem:\r\n1.\tcreate a new temporary folder in the web  interface.\r\n2.\tmove all folders that cannot be deleted in this temporary folder.\r\n3.\tdelete the temporary folder.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/22873684","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/2404#issuecomment-22873684","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/2404","id":22873684,"user":{"login":"signum","id":36562,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/2d05cbc622c6f92b90b3777c9c23d6ef?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2fc59058a3b014852af6a78ac0806a0bcb.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"2d05cbc622c6f92b90b3777c9c23d6ef","url":"https://api.github.com/users/signum","html_url":"https://github.com/signum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/signum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/signum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/signum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/signum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/signum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/signum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/signum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/signum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/signum/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-19t14:01:42z","updated_at":"2013-08-19t14:01:42z","body":"i
