i read #3054 now, and can see why this was done.\r\n\r\nbasically, it seems updater.php returns two versions: \"5.0.8 owncloud 5.0.6\", where internal version = 5.0.8 (used to trigger database updates), and human readable release version = owncloud 5.0.6.\r\n\r\nthey used to be in sync but not anymore, and that desync was required because of the accident in bug #3054 where the database version had been accidentally bumped by 1 which meant that all future updates would need to keep bumping it higher than the actual release number, to continue to trigger the databaseupdate script.\r\n\r\nokay... the strange version check strings make sense now. i'll update my own version check code to use the \"owncloud 5.0.6\" versionstring as its reference

i am not even involved with owncloud yet i'll chime in with +1, that's just so much more logical.\r\n\r\ncurrently, i have incorporated updater.php into my email notification script which alerts me when software is outdated on my servers. the updater.php script returns an xml file with these values:\r\n\r\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\r\n    <owncloud>\r\n      <version>5.0.8</version>\r\n      <versionstring>owncloud 5.0.6</versionstring>\r\n      <url>http://download.owncloud.org/community/owncloud-5.0.6.tar.bz2</url>\r\n      <web>http://owncloud.org/</web>\r\n    </owncloud>\r\n\r\nthey used to be in sync so i assumed version was the machine-readable version and versionstring was the full product name, and therefore i ended up using the version-tag. turns out that's just the internal version which was the cause of the confusion.\r\n\r\nperhaps the official release date could be used for the \"should we update the database?\" purposes instead. like:\r\n\r\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\r\n    <owncloud>\r\n      <releasedate>2013-05-14</releasedate>\r\n      <version>5.0.6</version>\r\n      <versionstring>owncloud 5.0.6</versionstring>\r\n      <url>http://download.owncloud.org/community/owncloud-5.0.6.tar.bz2</url>\r\n      <web>http://owncloud.org/</web>\r\n    </owncloud>\r\n\r\nif that messes with betatesters (since no release date is known yet at that time), perhaps something else can be used, like a temporary date in the future, or a manually incremented integer, one for each new release/beta?\r\n\r\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\r\n    <owncloud>\r\n      <release>21</release>\r\n      <version>5.0.6</version>\r\n      <versionstring>owncloud 5.0.6</versionstring>\r\n
