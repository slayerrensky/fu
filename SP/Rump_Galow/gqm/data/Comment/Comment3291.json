haven't heard about the problem before, but if it's a general issue for osx addressbook exports, someone should write a simple script that fixes the vcards. if i were to try to fix it when parsing the file, there would be a high risk that it would break import of valid vcards. i suggest you search at http://forum.owncloud.org/search.php?keywords=osx+address+book - maybe someone there has the same problem. otherwise you can post a message asking people for an easy solution.\r\nwe would be happy to distribute such a script with owncloud, but it's out of scope for the contacts app.\r\na quick search gave e.g. this: http://www.unix.com/shell-programming-scripting/116667-remove-backslash-character-file.html\r\nyou would have to loop through the file and of course only fix the lines with categories\r\n\r\nbut it's your decision
