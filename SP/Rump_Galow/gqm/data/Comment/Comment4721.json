the problem is a redirect loop. after the app was enabled it gets loaded the next time you perform a action. at this point in time the app will detect that the encryption app is not yet initialized and log you out. this works fine if your first action after enabling the app is for example to go back to the files view. but if your first action is that you log out by yourself than we will end up in a redirect loop.\r\n\r\ni already have a fix for master together with the new error messages (pull request https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/4691). in master we no longer force your to log out but instead display a warning that you should log out and log in again. for the new error messages i did some larger changes, so i would like to avoid to backport it to stable5. on the other hand i don't want to disable the enforced log-out without the new error messages. because than the user can continue using his owncloud without getting notified that the encryption is not initialized.\r\n\r\ni will have another look at it on monday, maybe i will find a way to fix it in stable without the big changes. but don't count on it.\r\n\r\nworkaround for now: don't directly log-out after enabling the app but for example go back to files or any other app. or just interrupt the redirect loop by reloading the

debugged this a bit further. it looks like this problem only occurs if the \"remember\" checkbox was checked during login and the cookie was set. in this case owncloud directly tries to log you in
