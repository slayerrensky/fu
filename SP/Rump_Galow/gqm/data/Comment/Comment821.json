on this, i think itâ€™s best to move the search from being â»globalâ« in the header, to be inside the applications directly. this is better for several reasons:\r\n\r\n* if search is in the header, it is expected to search _everything_. the problem is that simply only a few apps support search in the first place. even files doesnâ€™t support it fully (shared folder).\r\n* it allows for better integration into the app itself. the apps would have the search on the top of the app sidebar, and it would automatically filter both areas (app navigation and app content), instead of having this weird popover on the top right. every app would only have one search bar. also see how http://icloud.com does that, or, say, google apps.\r\n* we can still do the â»results from other appsâ« below
