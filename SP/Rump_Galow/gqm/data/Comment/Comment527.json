want to add my description of aparently the same issue. \r\nthomas gave me the hint that this entry might be the same issue, i agree with that. \r\ni cite my mail to the list below, since i think it can offer additional info: \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nsince about 2 weeks i encounter a funny issue in git master when firing an \r\najax request under certain circumstances: \r\n\r\nownclouds webui loads fine, but ajax requests fail. error message: \r\n{\"data\":{\"message\":\"authentication error\"},\"status\":\"error\"}\r\n\r\naparently this only happens when a session existed before and has expired.  \r\nwhen i use a reload inside the browser then the above issue happens. no \r\nproblem after a fresh login, so it is not an implementation problem of that \r\najax script.\r\n\r\nsecons aspect: when i get this error i would like to re-login (though that is \r\npretty annoying). so i now click the 'logout' button the page reloads instead \r\nof sending me to the login page. i have to logout a second time to be \r\nable to login again. after that procedure all works fine again, including the \r\najax request. that problem started about 2 weeks ago, i cannot remember a \r\nsingle incident like this before although i tested a lot with sessions and \r\nexpiration about 2 month ago when implementing the self-extending csrf tokens \r\nmyself. \r\nsince that csrf-implementation has been altered (simplyfied) inbetween i dare \r\nto say that most likely the issue has been introduced with those changes... i \r\nsuspect that unlike before the csrf tokens are not refreshed any more in \r\nbackground and expire. that is a big problem for apps that do not require a \r\nfull reload all the time but load only once.
