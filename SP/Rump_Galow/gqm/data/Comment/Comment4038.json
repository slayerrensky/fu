pluggable views could be a solution. \"files\" is the core, but an image view or a audio streaming view, even a calendar view, could be added. these views might only show a certain kind of files,

essentially the way it is now. â»picturesâ« is the image view, â»musicâ« is the audio streaming view. and thatâ€™s where my point is: these pictures and music views currently are inferior in

problem is, i think, that the views are separated from the files and their ordering can be different. if there would be different \"templates\" for views that could be used for the files app, and the files app would remember in which directory what view was activated, something interesting could be possible ... especially if the files core exports its functions to all other view templates. even a

think views are a great addition to the files app, but they don't \nreally replace the functionality provided by eg. a dedicated music app \nthat shows all the albums you have. maybe if we followed the \nxdg-user-dirs spec the music view for the ~/music folder could show all \nalbums contained in that folder and it's children. same with ~/pictures \nand the gallery view. i guess most of the dirs specified in the spec \nmight make sense:\n\n```\n xdg_desktop_dir=\"$home/desktop\"\n xdg_download_dir=\"$home/downloads\"\n xdg_templates_dir=\"$home/templates\"\n xdg_publicshare_dir=\"$home/public\"\n xdg_documents_dir=\"$home/documents\"\n xdg_music_dir=\"$home/music\"\n xdg_pictures_dir=\"$home/pictures\"\n xdg_videos_dir=\"$home/videos\"\n```\n i would rather like a ~/todo folder used by the notes app storing \nfiles in a somewhat standard todo.txt format: \nhttp://owncloud.org/todo-txt-for-owncloud-with-todos/ thx @gomez\n\ni can even imagine something like that for ~/bookmarks. maybe in \nnetscapes bookmarks.html format: \nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa753582(v=vs.85).aspx\n\ncalendar and contacts happen to use sabredav, but they won't fit into \nthe filesystem until we save provide them as vcard or ical files. that \nmight go with unix 'everythin is a file' doctrine, but i fail to see \nthe benefit. they, and the notes app, are in the pim category, which \nimho needs a dedicated app (although i like the calendar view for \nfiles, mostly recently used files that is ... like zeitgeists activity \njournal).\n\nfile centric is a well understood paradigm but not all apps can provide \na flat file based representation of their content. thinking about this \ni guess this is an evolutionary process. some functionality starts as \nan app (news) and some apps are created to improve interacting with \nspecial files (gallery, music ...). not all apps should expose their \ndata via webdav, eg. the calendar and contacts apps might get confused \nwhen the ical/vcard files are overwritten via webdav ... i don't know.\n\ni guess we can compare this to the desktop. we have a bunch of files \nthere and we have special apps for audio/video playback etc. and we can \ndo different things in the file explorer and music player of our \nchoice. sharing something in a file centric app such as music, video, \ngallery and todo basically is the same as sharing a file and should be \nimplemented the same way. apps storing their data in the database \n(calendar, contacts) share their data with the sharing api and an app \nrelated share type.\n\nthe files app won't go away and i assume many users like to access \ntheir pictures via webdav. maybe there is even a use case for accessing \nyour contacts via ~/addressbook/*name*.vcard...\n\ni think we can only try to come up with a guideline for what users \nmight expect of an app over plain file based access."}]
