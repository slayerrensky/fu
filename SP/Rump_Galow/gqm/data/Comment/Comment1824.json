apologies - the app button was trash bin in previous releases, i just looked at the daily build and it is deleted files, that is good.\r\n\r\nthe problem is that the app, the source code and the activity button have different names. so, we should have the same name, or really similar names in the ui the customer sees, it just makes everything less confusing.  so deleted files is a great descriptive app name and button name...they should be the same.  not a huge change, but the name that is displayed should be consistent.  perhaps the code can stay the same...with the display name different?  not sure the effort

had a discussion about it a few days ago. @jancborchardt was also involved. unfortunately i can't find it anymore.\r\n\r\nthe result of the discussion was that \"deleted files\" is a great descriptive

because the \"trash bin\" is a well known concept from desktop systems and the name highlights what you actually get -> a trash bin for your deleted files. in this context i think \"deleted files\" is not that obvious. at least i would wonder what a \"deleted files\" app does.\r\n\r\nthis just as some background information how we end app with the app name \"trash bin\" and the button name
