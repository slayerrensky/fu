\r\ni compared it to other apps and i'd say no, that is not the cause: \r\nin appinfo/app.php it calls ocp\\app::addnavigationentry() once to define a navigation entry. then in index.php it calls ocp\\app::setactivenavigationentry() once using the same entry id as declared before. \r\nactually you raise an interesting point, since the app indeed calls itself a second time internally in certain situations. however even if this second time (required to play the imprints content upon request) reinterprets appinfo/app.php it would call ocp\\app::addnavigationentry() a second time with exactly the same arguments: \"imprint\", no leading capital letter around anywhere...\r\n\r\n@vicdeo: \r\nyep, that is what i sketched as my idea for the cause too. \r\ni cannot change that title at apps.owncloud.com myself. but even considered that went wrong back then i still think this is a bug. certainly it is fine to have matching details of information in all sources. however it is a questionable design if different sources of information are used at different times. this must lead to differences sooner or later.
