i think i know why you had problems. let me elaborate here, since no one responded in #922. there was nothing wrong with the way the fix worked. the issue is with the script that \"generates\" the file row in the list after it is uploaded. if you refresh the page the link returns to normal and there are no issues.\r\n\r\nit appears that the faulty code that executes when the upload completes comes short on the link and you get a \"cloud not found\" error.\r\n\r\nexample,\r\n\r\nthe faulty link is https://.../download.php?file=//a43l2616b.pdf\r\n\r\nafter the refresh it returns to
