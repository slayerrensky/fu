had the same problem with polish characters. i tested it on  5.x versions (win 7, apache2.4, php5.4.x) and my workaround is translating paths and filenames to/from utf8. i made some modifications to: lib/files/storage/mappedlocal.php (this is used for windows filesystem). \r\n\r\nmethod mappedlocal->opendir use php method readdir which not return utf-8 names. my changes:\r\n\r\n    public function opendir($path) {\r\n        $files = array('.', '..');\r\n        $physicalpath = $this->buildpath($path, true, false);//modification\r\n        $logicalpath =

opendir('fakedir://local-win32'.$path);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnext i added two private methods:\r\n\r\n    private static function toutf8($value){\r\n        return iconv('', 'utf-8', $value);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static function fromutf8($value){\r\n        return iconv('utf-8', '', $value);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nand last change relates to method buildpath:\r\n\r\n    private function buildpath($path, $create=true, $convertencoding=true) {//modification\r\n        $path = $this->stripleading($path);\r\n        $fullpath = $this->datadir.$path;\r\n        $path =
