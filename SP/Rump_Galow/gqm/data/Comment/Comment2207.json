your team claims it cannot. but this does not say, it is gone. it's somewhere lurking in your code.\r\n\r\nsee also https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/74 and this https://github.com/owncloud/mirall/issues/44 in which i demand since a long time to have a way to show server fingerprints in the client at any time, which is an essential issue to detect mitm
