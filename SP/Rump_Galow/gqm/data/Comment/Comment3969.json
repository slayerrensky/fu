the file belongs. how will this work in the future? \r\nit would be really important to know this as early as possible to know what needs to be done if the api really breaks. we have at least 4 important apps which needs to be adjusted (files, contacts, calendar and encryption). this could be a lot of work, not only to migrate but also to stabilize the code again.\r\n\r\non remark on your definitions in the wiki. you describe share type as \"user\" , \"group\", \"link\", \"email address\". email doesn't really fit in here. it is just a way to transport the link, this doesn't really matter here. i would say that share types are only \"user\", \"group\" and \"link\" (maybe \"public\" would be a even better name).\r\n\r\ngenerally i like the new structure even if i'm not completely

consequence of realizing the necessity of storing multiple parent references for reshares as mentioned in the description. that was not in the original plan for this rewrite and i spent days trying to avoid it, in the end it is the only major design difference. at that point, i decided i might as well restructure the database layout to something proper because i would have to do an update anyways.

acceptance tests will come when i tie it into the ui - nothing should break. the tests for sharing now represent 25% of the tests run for core - this will become one of the most stable parts of

offset workaround als breaks joins that select columns with the same name from two tables like in\r\n```sql\r\nora-00918: column ambiguously defined select a.↯* from (select \"oc_shares\".*, \"oc_shares_links\".* from \"oc_shares\" join \"oc_shares_links\" on \"oc_shares\".\"id\" = \"oc_shares_links\".\"id\" where \"share_type_id\" = :param1 and \"item_type\" = :param2 and \"oc_shares\".\"id\" = :param3) a where rownum <= 1\r\n```\r\nthe ↯ marks the place where the error appears. the reason are the two `id` columns from oc_shares and oc_shares_links. the solution is to specify exactly which columns you need from which table or give them a unique name with eg `id as link_id`. this is where i stopped getting sharing to work on oracle, because i don't know what the code following the select requires.\r\n- [ ] if you want more debug output try changing the code of oci8exception in
