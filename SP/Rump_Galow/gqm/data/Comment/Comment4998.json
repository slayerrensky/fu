some more context: i brought owncloud into our college. after using it successfully for some time internally, we started using it for projects with external users. in the beginning we created (temporary) guest accounts and our external users used webdav. worked great!\r\nnow these external groups start to be whole school teams. we no longer wanted to create an temporary account for every external team member. so we tried public links with enabled upload. unfortunately, the usability and user acceptance of the webdav interface is much higher than the browser interface (and we don't know how to access a shared link via webdav...) therefore we shared one guest account for the whole external school team and let them access via webdav. this also works great ... until one member of the group decides to change the password of the guest account. ;-)"}]
