can navigate and the url will change. using the browser previous/next buttons also work.\r\n\r\nhowever, there are the following issues:\r\n1) if the ie8 user got a link from a non-ie8 user, like \"files.php?dir=somedir\", the page will appear fine initially. then, when the ie8 user navigates, we can only change the hash part, so this will make the url ugly like \"files.php?dir=somedir#?dir=somesubdir\" (changing the part before the hash would reload the whole page)\r\n\r\n2) if the ie8 user opens a subdir url directly by pasting it in, like \"files.php#?dir=somedir\", the hash part is never sent to the server (technical limitation). so the server will always return the contents of the root dir.\r\nthe workaround i put in the js code (filelist.js:initfromhash()) is to directlty change the directory after load (there is a little delay)\r\nthis means there will be some loading overhead, which depends on the size of the root dir.\r\nanother solution would be to make the files app \"full ajax\" which means that when opening a dir, the index.php will return the list container without file list, then let the js code load the initial file list.\r\n\r\napart for this it seems to work fine.\r\n\r\nany thoughts on this ?"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/23520725","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/4501#issuecomment-23520725","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/4501","id":23520725,"user":{"login":"deepdiver1975","id":1005065,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/bdba071ed68da9ce8edae53c364902ef?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f67e101ad9531b7d25697b76e503e062e.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"bdba071ed68da9ce8edae53c364902ef","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975","html_url":"https://github.com/deepdiver1975","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-29t20:27:05z","updated_at":"2013-08-29t20:27:05z","body":">
