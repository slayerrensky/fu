come on i don't want to rewrite your app, i only try to find a better user experience using the external storage app so if you look at the processing time this should clearly explain the problem, please don't be pissed off, this is not my intention! \r\n\r\ni had hoped i can get some constructive feedback to find a solution. but your reaction let me guess you don't want or need solution here? are your satisfied with about 9 second's upload time, i don't think so.\r\n\r\ni created this pr mainly to discuss this problem and to find a solution **together**, \r\nmaybe it was my fault because i did not clearly explain my goal at the topic.\r\n\r\nso what you think is the best place for this logic? or did you see a better way to solve this problem?\r\n\r\nlet me try to explain the problem i see. when a file get stored we call typically file_put_contents from this point we have code partially from other apps like files_version and partially from underlying places like the file scanner where check operation like file_exists are executed. this check operations will result without a lock into a api call which costs time. \r\nif we put a lock till file_put_contents is done we can prevent unnecessary api calls and save time.\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/18810134","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/3574#issuecomment-18810134","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/3574","id":18810134,"user":{"login":"mtgap","id":1097106,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/454a73ee5feeb428d0c163a48903332c?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f52d29a66f285a1d61125dd69ac0766b2.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"454a73ee5feeb428d0c163a48903332c","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap","html_url":"https://github.com/mtgap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtgap/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-06-02t17:35:58z","updated_at":"2013-06-02t17:35:58z","body":"i'm
