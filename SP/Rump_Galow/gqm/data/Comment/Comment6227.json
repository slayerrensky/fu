?\r\n\r\nat the moment i have no idea... but if it even happens again, please report the issue here, @boran. the crucial part is that we always need the keys i mentioned above. it is quite wired that the keys get lost in one of the steps, i never saw such a behaviour/bug, but this doesn't mean that there is no bug.\r\n\r\n> if you connect the client before the migration (initial encryption) is

necessary encryption keys. this should result in client errors and the client should stop syncing files. but of course this shouldn't result in data lost.\r\n\r\n> if the client is started while the migration is run, not sure what could happen. would it start syncing the part of the dir that was already synced or will it be blocked until all files were migrated ?\r\n\r\nhm, good question. we make sure that the client doesn't start a second migration run. but i'm not sure if he will try to sync half-migrated files. this could be a problem but it should only result in broken files not in missing keys. we should probably block log-ins as long as the migration is running... i will look into this case. but i'm not sure if it is the root of the problem described by @boran
