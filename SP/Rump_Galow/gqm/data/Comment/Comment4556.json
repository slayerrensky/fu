only strange things i see here : \r\n- php_flag short_open_tag on\r\n- mod_negociation\r\n\r\nbut i dont think that's the problem. \r\n\r\ni see nowhere in your conf the basic auth stuff. do you have some like its said in the topic, or do you just have classical owncloud auth ?"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/23898883","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/4556#issuecomment-23898883","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/4556","id":23898883,"user":{"login":"mpettitt","id":373181,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/72369f9f8516deb32ccdccdc7b531b1d?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2fe5351436a76fe427f193b7963a1a328c.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"72369f9f8516deb32ccdccdc7b531b1d","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpettitt","html_url":"https://github.com/mpettitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpettitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpettitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpettitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpettitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpettitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpettitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpettitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpettitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpettitt/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-09-05t20:26:57z","updated_at":"2013-09-05t20:26:57z","body":"whatever

would like to update this issue. i have a debian 7 server with apache2, i created a subfolder in the owncloud (5.0.13)  directory which contained a .htpasswd (/owncloud/subfolder/.htpasswd). the .htpasswd asked for an user (pedro) and a password contained in an other directory.\r\n\r\nafter testing it a little bit i removed the whole /owncloud/subfolder. then i started getting this redirect loops. so i deleted the whole /owncloud, and installed a fresh owncloud 6.0.0a. in the set up, i created an user called juan.\r\n\r\nnow the problem is that right after i try to login i get redirected back to the login page but with the link:\r\nhttps://web/index.php?redirecturl=%2findex.php%2fapps%2ffiles\r\n\r\nso i cannot acces my files from the web. what it is important is the /owncloud/data/owncloud.og:\r\n{\"app\":\"core\",\"message\":\"session user-id (juan) doesn't match server[php_auth_user] (pedro).\",\"level\":2,\"time\":\"2013-12-16t00:07:18+00:00\"}\r\n\r\nso therefore even i deleted my initial .htpasswd and made a new fresh install there is something remaining makin a conflict with owncloud.\r\n\r\ni have to say also that i do can access without ssl. so does anyone knows where the conflict is?"}]
