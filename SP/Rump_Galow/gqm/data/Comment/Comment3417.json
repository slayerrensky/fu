disables the use of xcache completely).\r\n\r\nas owncloud does not requires xcache and seems happy if xcache is not installed in the first place, it should handle an unsuitable (but apparently common) configuration better. suggestions:\r\n\r\n* check if correct version/configuration of xcache is there (not only if xcache is available), and if not, return a meaningful error and don't let it just fail with a server error.\r\n* have a config setting not to use xcache even if installed, so the user has a choice. \r\n* if you absolutely require xcache, then state in the documentation clearly
