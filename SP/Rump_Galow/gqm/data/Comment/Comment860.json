files anyway if only a change to the file content is considered a different version; but with the idea that \"every file should probably at least have 2 versions\" there definitely would have to be exclusions, and a sensible default configuration for these exclusions (e.g. all files bigger than 1mb excluded from that duplication). if i understand that correctly it would mean to basically create a copy for each versioned file, right?  or is it just meant that the versioning app always shows at least one version, named e.g. \"current\", or by the last modified date of the file? the latter would be far better than duplication.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/11339866","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/860#issuecomment-11339866","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/860","id":11339866,"user":{"login":"jancborchardt","id":925062,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f84ec51f9ceed468217d4e13abf78da9c.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt","html_url":"https://github.com/jancborchardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-12-13t16:02:19z","updated_at":"2012-12-13t16:02:19z","body":"@randolfcarter
