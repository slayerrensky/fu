the problem with apache leads to the situation that owncloud (and any other application) thinks it's used without https (as you see: server_port is 80 for http and not 443 for https), even if it is used with it. so, the infinte redirect (to https) is the logical result because owncloud can't detect the usage of ssl. although you could avoid the problem by the workaround mentioned by @karlitschek , it's in my opinion a bug that should be worked around on the server (and not the application) basis."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/11447727","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/464#issuecomment-11447727","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/464","id":11447727,"user":{"login":"deepdiver1975","id":1005065,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/bdba071ed68da9ce8edae53c364902ef?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f67e101ad9531b7d25697b76e503e062e.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"bdba071ed68da9ce8edae53c364902ef","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975","html_url":"https://github.com/deepdiver1975","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-12-17t16:10:12z","updated_at":"2012-12-17t16:10:12z","body":"closing
