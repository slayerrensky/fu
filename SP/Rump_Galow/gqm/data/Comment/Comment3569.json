which i don't think is what it should be doing.\r\n\r\ni wasn't able to find out why the function couldn't find a template in the first place for in another installation that works just fine without the patch owncloud will always pick the other branch of the outer if-then-else condition, namely the one where $app is empty. what exactly triggers the difference in behavior i don't know. tried with different versions of php, used 5.3 as well as 5.4 - on the failing system it would always use the \"wrong\" and now fixed branch.\r\n\r\nanyway, it works for me, you can give it a spin at your own risk. always remember: you break it, you own the pieces."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/20249638","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/3569#issuecomment-20249638","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/3569","id":20249638,"user":{"login":"vicdeo","id":991300,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/57b8c1e26d502d5414e4b2fb875d2994?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2fe8357fefe8bad5436de368fa5a419461.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"57b8c1e26d502d5414e4b2fb875d2994","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo","html_url":"https://github.com/vicdeo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-06-30t16:12:19z","updated_at":"2013-06-30t16:12:19z","body":"@rustydust there is a great possibility you hit a bug fixed by  https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/3770"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/20252054","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/3569#issuecomment-20252054","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/3569","id":20252054,"user":{"login":"sona1111","id":4585193,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/c0f27411f4befbb8e61e9e5ad35c297f?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f265c3496fb9a3d0dd42425ab7716e56e.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"c0f27411f4befbb8e61e9e5ad35c297f","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sona1111","html_url":"https://github.com/sona1111","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sona1111/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sona1111/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sona1111/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sona1111/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sona1111/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sona1111/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sona1111/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sona1111/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sona1111/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-06-30t17:47:57z","updated_at":"2013-06-30t17:47:57z","body":"@rustydust, thank you so much! that code did the trick and i am back up.
