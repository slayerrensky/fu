thought is that if you are seeing errors related to script_name and script_filename, it's because calling cron.php from cli doesn't define those elements in the $_server array when you're not running the script via cgi/sapi.  without looking in more detail (i've only just read through your report and looked at the code causing the error), i don't know what in cron.php might cause that code to be called since there are specific checks to rule that out.  it could be a poorly-behaving plugin, it could also be that owncloud is not detecting your cli usage correctly.\r\n\r\nthe fastest way to potentially address the issue is to call cron.php via curl or wget in the crontab instead of executing it directly.  doing so should cause those values to be present in the array, which should address the error.\r\n\r\non my system, i see no errors when running the cron.php directly with the [forum script](http://forum.owncloud.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=11301).  it would be useful to see the output of php_sapi_name() on your system.  put this into a file called test.php on your server:\r\n\r\n  ```php\r\n  <?php echo php_sapi_name(); ?>\r\n  ```\r\n\r\nthen in the shell, call `/usr/bin/php
