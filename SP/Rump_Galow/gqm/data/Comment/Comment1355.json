in the web interface should work. there are some known issues with the sync client though.\r\n\r\nit is ok that the name in oc_share doesn't change. the reasons for this is that a user can get shares from many different users and folders. therefore we create a unique name for all items in the shared folder which can be different to the original name already at the beginning. to avoid collisions we don't change the share-name if the name of the original gets changed.\r\n\r\nthe important column in oc_share is the item_source which points to the corresponding file/folder in the fscache. please check this value and compare it with the ids in oc_fscache. since a rename doesn't change the id of a file/folder the id should be the same both in oc_fscache and oc_share before and after the rename operation."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/13331151","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/1355#issuecomment-13331151","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/1355","id":13331151,"user":{"login":"karlitschek","id":867445,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/87ce2b4531ee1a0c32b50e0d8f049224?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f06e7098636caebfc9c30c9f52eb905df.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"87ce2b4531ee1a0c32b50e0d8f049224","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek","html_url":"https://github.com/karlitschek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-02-09t13:01:15z","updated_at":"2013-02-09t13:01:15z","body":"@schiesbn
