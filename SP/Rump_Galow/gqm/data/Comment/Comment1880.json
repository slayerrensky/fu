any time you update your local branch of core you should also update your submodules.  this is as simple as the following:\r\n\r\n    $ git fetch --all\r\n    $ git merge origin/master\r\n    $ git submodule update\r\n\r\n> this also mean that someone/... has to sync submodule hash every-time there is a bugfix or smth in an app... /o\\ \r\n\r\nyou would only have to sync this for the next release.  you could push a fix to an submodule and pull it into a remote repository independent of actually updating core (though you would likely want to merge it in for the next release of core).\r\n\r\n> not sure about it but i think that if a committer forgot to \"submodule update\" then commit -a (ok it's the user fault but...) the submodule get reverted :) \r\n\r\nthis is incorrect.  if a user merged in updates to core without updating their submodules their .gitmodules file would still list the current (correct) hash, they'd just have an out-of-date submodule in their local repository.\r\n\r\n> submodule are kind of pita to work with branches ...\r\n\r\npersonally, i don't find them a problem but can understand how others might.  just be sure to run a submodule update
