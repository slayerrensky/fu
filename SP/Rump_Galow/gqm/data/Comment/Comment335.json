you very much for testing!\r\n\r\n> 1] if you create a folder , changes are not propagate correctly (but thi works using web interface)\r\n\r\ni can't reproduce this. can you give me a concrete example which i can try to reproduce? just to be sure, you create a directory in a shared directory (not in the root shared-directory) where you have the right to create new directories/files, right?\r\n\r\n> 2] if you move a directory , changes are not propagate correctly\r\n\r\ni just tried it.this happens with both, the sync client and the web interface, right? this is really bad but not a sync client only problem. i will try to come up with a patch for this problem. the patch we are discussing here deals with problems directly related to the sync client and not with more general sharing bugs.\r\n\r\ndo we have a bug report for this issue? if not, please open one.
