app is inaccessible. deleting the mounts.js file restores functionality, but obviously removes the s3 info. this s3 bucket and key pair was used with a 4.x version of owncloud with great success, so something was definitely broken in the 5.0 version. has anyone actually gotten the s3 functionality to work with the latest release? my guess is not."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/15236961","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/1692#issuecomment-15236961","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/1692","id":15236961,"user":{"login":"cshotton","id":490077,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/b4e73f4d7cf8289886a579c0d163f60e?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2fc9945c05323f6ac621dcb6ed9122e9a4.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"b4e73f4d7cf8289886a579c0d163f60e","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshotton","html_url":"https://github.com/cshotton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshotton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshotton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshotton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshotton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshotton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshotton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshotton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshotton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshotton/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-03-21t13:11:25z","updated_at":"2013-03-21t13:11:25z","body":"turns out that owncloud's s3 support has a dependency on the curl php libraries that are not reflected in the owncloud package itself. so installing owncloud from a debian/ubuntu package and then trying to
