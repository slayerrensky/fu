took a closer look. first, an empyt base is undocumented in the php documentation. but it looks to be fine.\r\n\r\na catch is that if the base dn is left empty, the base entry in ldap.conf is being used. we do not know what is written there, making it a source of failure. you will need to configure this as well, either by specifying the base dn or assure it is empty.\r\n\r\nbecause of this error prone config situation, i do not like it. on the other hand i see your scenario. i reopen it and mark the issue as
