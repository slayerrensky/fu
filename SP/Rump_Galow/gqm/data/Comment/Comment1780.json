it seem to, that this issue came up in of a combination of\r\n- using owncloud and its client since beta\r\n- in any constellation before, the server files got saved in wrong format (non-utf8) but it looked like correct utf-8\r\nwhile \"auftragsbestãƒâ¤tigungen\" is the latin1 encoded utf-8 string \"auftragsbestã¤tigungen\" (umlaut: hex c3 a4 == u+00e4 == ã¤ == utf-8 latin small letter a with diaeresis) the old directory displayed like \"auftragsbestaãœë†tigungen\" in latin1 (umlaut: hex 61 cc 88 == a (61) *plus* u+0308 ==  combining diaeresis) console has some strange umlauts in neither correct utf8 nor latin encoded. perhaps it was saved once in a false encoding on sync with an old client version and somewhere rewritten. possibly this happened several times in distortion order so this umlaut got broken.\r\n\r\nunfortunatly i'm also not able to reproduce this atm ;(\r\n\r\nserver didn't changed since one year, so the setup wasn't the problem. it's still the same and correct (for me). \r\n\r\nso back to your question: can you please test what happens if you'll \"inject\" some wrong encoded files in the /files folder on your serverside and resync? it seems to error handling if there are two files calling the same in utf-8 but written either in latin1 and any other non-utf8 encoding.\r\nanyway: you might see in the description above, there seems to be a change in writing umlauts on sync. it was both \"correct\" utf-8 but the older one was created by using combinating characters.\r\n\r\nso i hope the problem is a little bit clearer now and i didn't write too confusing
