it asks â»if you haven't enabled the recovery keyâ« â€“ donâ€™t we know that?\r\n\r\nno because at this point we don't know which user accesses the password lost page.\r\n\r\n> if the recovery key is not enabled and you forget your password, your files are lost, right?\r\n\r\nright\r\n\r\n> it should not be possible to have encryption without recovery key.\r\n\r\ni disagree. no serious security system has something like a recovery key. can you recover you gnupg encrypted files if you lose your password or private key? no. can you use your openssl key if you lose your password? no. can you access your encrypted hard disk if you lose your password? no.\r\n\r\nsecurity and privacy always means that only i have access to my data and only i know how to access it. if i forget how to access my files than it is my fault. depending on my own security level i can do different things: tell my wife the password, make a backup of my data somewhere else, write the password on a piece of paper and hide it somewhere in my office, use a password manager, put the password in a bank deposit safe, etc. or if i'm really paranoid i store the password only in my head, with all advantages and disadvantages.\r\n\r\nfor owncloud we already provide a trade-off. if the admin wants to offer it and the user wants to trust the admin than the admin can have a additional key to access the data. but i wouldn't force people to share their data to a second person. that's completely against the basic idea of security and privacy.\r\n\r\n> even when the recovery key is enabled, there needs to be admin interaction, right?\r\n\r\nyes, only the admin who knows the recovery key password can recover files.\r\n\r\n> no one reads long advisory texts. tl;dr my data will be gone if i check the box.\r\n\r\nmight be true. but if we enter areas like encryption not everything is that easy. people also accept to read the manual of their dishwasher or coffee machine but expect, that something as complex as a secure and encrypted storage for all their data can be done with just a blink, that's just naive.\r\n\r\ndon't understand me wrong. i'm all in favour of easy to use and intuitive interfaces. but if a system reaches a certain complexity which effects users data, than the user must also be ready to read at least 2-3 sentences in some circumstances. hiding the information is not a solution.\r\n\r\n> hence iâ€™d say we make it impossible to go for the data loss way and make admin interaction mandatory\r\n\r\nwe could just disable the automated password recovery by mail for encrypted ownclouds. but than everybody would have to go to the admin, even if the admin can't recover his files.\r\n\r\none reason why i keep the option available: people store more than there files in owncloud. so imagine i have enabled the recovery key, lost my password but now urgently need access to my calendar, contacts, tasks, whatever. in this case i don't want to wait for the admin, so i can reset the password, access all the other data and the files can still be recovered from the admin later on.\r\n\r\n> encryption should not be possible without recovery key. if you donâ€™t trust the admin, host your own instance\r\n\r\nas explained above, i don't think that this is a good idea.\r\n\r\n> password reset should not be possible when encryption is enabled. admin contact (and recovery key stuff) should be mandatory.\r\n\r\ncan be done easily. but as explained above this would increase the work load for the admin (even in cases where he can't recover the files) and would inhibit instant access to other data by the user.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/19810469","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/3808#issuecomment-19810469","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/3808","id":19810469,"user":{"login":"vicdeo","id":991300,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/57b8c1e26d502d5414e4b2fb875d2994?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2fe8357fefe8bad5436de368fa5a419461.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"57b8c1e26d502d5414e4b2fb875d2994","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo","html_url":"https://github.com/vicdeo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-06-21t11:20:03z","updated_at":"2013-06-21t11:38:37z","body":"i
