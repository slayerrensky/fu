am working on a lucene based search, but have not yet done a performance analysis. it currently completely replaces the existing search capabilities (so you will loose the ability to search in calendar events, contacts and artist or album names in media files) but it indexes pdf, text and html files whenever they change. to try it out, download the search_lucene app from my repository: https://github.com/butonic/apps/tree/search_lucene/search_lucene \r\n\r\nafter enabling the app upload a file. it will be indexed and you should be able to search the contents of the file by using the default search field in the top right. it will not automatically search partial words for performance reasons, but you can use the lucene query syntax: http://www.lucenetutorial.com/lucene-query-syntax.html\r\n\r\nlet me know if this works for you ... or just disable the app and everything should be back to normal
