running multiple instances of a software via  the``https://ssl-proxy.tld/domain.tld/`` scheme defeats the purpose of the same origin policy. i am not arguing against those kinds of setup (see my comment earlier), but by educating i mean exactly that: empower users to understand as closely as possible what kind of security a certain setup will buy them. for instance, the ``https://customer-number.ssl-proxy.tld/`` proxy scheme will protect them against same origin, but only as long as they are not trying to run several instances under the same customer number (unlikely, but unfortunately i have seen that happening).\r\n\r\ndon't get me wrong, all i am saying is that security is a hard problem and under certain conditions, ssl certificates are even available for free today, and wether or not a dedicated ssl proxy server is dubious depends entirely on their setup, which we can not vouch for as a vendor.\r\n\r\nps: contributions to the
