as well.\r\n\r\nfrom personal experience: i maintain a site which is essentially just a\r\ncollection of links and logos: http://libreprojects.net â€“ because wikipedia\r\nfunded that i also asked them about the logos then, and they said itâ€™s ok\r\nas long as i donâ€™t claim i made them.\r\nand again, itâ€™s the same when you use a twitter/delicious/facebook icon on\r\nyour blog to refer to that service. or when youâ€™re a news website writing\r\nan article on google drive and put a google drive logo in it. thatâ€™s what\r\nfair use / zitatrecht is for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non thu, dec 6,
