from the current top bar, which is just an empty blue pane? yes, thatâ€™s true. but currently the left side is crowded, which also is a big problem (see arguments in original post).\r\n2 improvements:\r\n* hard limit of 7 apps displayed in the top bar, rest gets hidden behind the â»moreâ« button\r\n* show app title only on hover (yes, after all â€¦, we can always adjust)\r\n\r\n**doesnâ€™t work on mobile:**\r\nof course this draft doesnâ€™t work yet on mobile, itâ€™s just a very early example. but look at the current owncloud master on mobile â€“ doesnâ€™t fare any better.\r\ni thought about making it work on mobile though, and this design change is an important base for that. the â»hide additional apps behind \"more\"â« scales down to even having only the owncloud logo, and showing the apps popup when you click the logo.\r\nthen, the search bar can also be narrower, and the name will be replaced by a to-come profile image (like the icons, and use a â»userâ« icon as fallback when thereâ€™s no image) and the name is not needed anymore.\r\nthat leaves in the top bar: logo, search button, menu button. _does_ work very well on mobile.\r\nthen the content area is app-navigation and app-content, very easy to switch between. for an example how that can work, check out http://litewrite.net on mobile â€“ just a simple menu button which moves the app-navigation in.\r\n\r\n**google+ does the left bar:**\r\nyes, but google+ is just one part of google. google _has_ a top bar, with plus, search, images, maps, play, youtube, gmail, drive, calendar, â€¦ sounds similar to the app platform we develop? also see what @lukasreschke said.\r\n\r\n**facebook has the left bar:**\r\ntrue, and so has unity (ubuntu).\r\n\r\nand while we are at comparisons:\r\n* os x does this too, albeit on the bottom rather than top, with the dock.\r\n* twitter also has a top bar navigation. and then specific to that part a left-side list.\r\n\r\n\r\nthe problem is that we have **two permanent bars**. i can/will play around with putting all in the left bar, but i think the fundamental issue here is that two bars just make everything look crowded."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/16647358","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/2995#issuecomment-16647358","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/2995","id":16647358,"user":{"login":"kondou-ger","id":1410802,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/917dab919ae812f8252b2f501c514b19?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2fd07869ed62cb1b7f88b731956ab913ee.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"917dab919ae812f8252b2f501c514b19","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kondou-ger","html_url":"https://github.com/kondou-ger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kondou-ger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kondou-ger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kondou-ger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kondou-ger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kondou-ger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kondou-ger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kondou-ger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kondou-ger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kondou-ger/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-04-19t11:03:29z","updated_at":"2013-04-19t11:05:04z","body":"throwing more stuff in:\r\n\r\n__re: userimage instead of username:__\r\nwhere to click then for personal settings, admin, etc.?\r\n\r\n__re: bar at the top:__\r\nalso consider that many displays today have 16:9 or 8:5 resolutions, thus going on the width with a menu gives more available space, than going on the height â€“ 1,6 or 1,7 times more â€“ considering the search bar and the logo taking space we, in theory, have _at least_ the same space on desktops.\r\nin practice (1680x1050 resolution, chromium without bookmark-bar â†’ 990px height):\r\n![screenshot348](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1410802/401581/979db67e-a8e0-11e2-9d55-f49344367b02.png)\r\n\r\n__re: mobile desgins:__\r\nthat should be another topic/design/theme to be honest â€¦\r\na responsive design would be best there. if the phone is hold horizontally the top bar might work, but vertically we need another design."}]
