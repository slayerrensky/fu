maybe also what you describe often happens shouldnâ€™å§ happen. if someone deletes a file, however big it might be, it should go to deleted files first and stay there for â€¦ some time i guess.

some extend you are right. but at the end it is not that easy. one problem is that we perform a \"copy\" and not a \"move\" (for good reasons). this means that we can temporarily overstep the quote. that's not a problem for a soft quota but if the quota is equal to your physical disk space this can be a problem. another point is that we want to reserve 50% of existing free space for the trash and 50% for versions. so if you are hard on the limit it is possible that you will not get enough additional free space because both the trash and the versioning app gets it share.\r\n\r\nalso keep in mind that we start to expire the oldest files first if we reach the limit. in most cases the last deleted file will stay in the trash bin. but if you are near your quota than we need to do the trade-off between keeping a file in the trash bin and perverse space for some more files.\r\n\r\nbut even if we can fine-tune the expire function in the future. still it is a good idea to give the user some hints what is going on. that's what the patch is for.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/16402079","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/2931#issuecomment-16402079","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/2931","id":16402079,"user":{"login":"jancborchardt","id":925062,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f84ec51f9ceed468217d4e13abf78da9c.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt","html_url":"https://github.com/jancborchardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-04-15t18:16:37z","updated_at":"2013-04-15t18:16:37z","body":"right,
