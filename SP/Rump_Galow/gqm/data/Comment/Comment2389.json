problem is that disabling mdb2_portability_empty_to_null does not teach oracle the difference between '' and null. we would get rid of the issues, yes. leaving this portability flag enabled will force use to take care of related problems in a way that solves them for oracle as well. i'll try to make this a list:\r\n\r\nmdb2_portability_empty_to_null enabled:\r\n- columns that might need to store '' must be defined without notnull constraint to make them work in any db\r\n- this is exactly what a dbal is meant to do for us, treat all dbms equal\r\n\r\nmdb2_portability_empty_to_null disabled:\r\n-
