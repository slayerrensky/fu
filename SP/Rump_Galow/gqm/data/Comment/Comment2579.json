floecksche,\r\n\r\ncan you do following test:\r\n- we need a plain fresh oc instance (fresh setup, empty database)\r\n- enable mysql to log sql statements and monitor the logfile (tail -f /........./mysql.log)\r\n  (expecting you use mysql)\r\n- mount sftp\r\n- start a timer (a watch is enough...)\r\n- click in files on the mounted drive (=folder) one time and monitor sql hash creation statements\r\n- whatever szenario, stay in files, donâ´t click around!\r\n\r\nszenario 1:\r\n- does this error come up when you go into the subfolder structure <during> hashing\r\n\r\nszenario 2:\r\n- prepare oc as above\r\n- does this error come up when you go into the subfolder structure <after finishing> hashing\r\n- document the time taken for finishing hashing and the wire speed for sftp
