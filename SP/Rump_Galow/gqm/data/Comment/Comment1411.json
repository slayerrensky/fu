because other browsers have native form validation, at least basic checking for required fields at the moment, and we donâ€™t use an extra js library or own code for that. in supported browsers it checks even before sending the request (= without needing a page refresh). ie, at least in older versions, most probably doesnâ€™t support this.\r\n\r\nthis seems to be an old owncloud version also

the quick fix solution i proposed is not really good. tried it out but any disabled style for the button just looks bad.\r\n\r\nmy idea then was a simple check on clicking the log in button if

except safari all have this checking built in: http://caniuse.com/#search=required\r\nand especially considering the problem is quite obvious (the fields are empty), i suggest we do not try to
