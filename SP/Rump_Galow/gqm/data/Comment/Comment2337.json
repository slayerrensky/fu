b character.\r\n\r\ni have my apache server setup to follow symlinks, so it seems that anything to do with symlinks and owncloud doesn't work... just a guess on my part.  \r\n\r\nas i said before, if i just put the distribution directly in my apache doc root (this includes the data dir) it all works fine, no symlinks.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/17877362","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/2337#issuecomment-17877362","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/2337","id":17877362,"user":{"login":"tomtomme","id":4428185,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/34afd804e63706527723330d33beea7a?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f04b2fa845da43f0f670c1d5bb304c205.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"34afd804e63706527723330d33beea7a","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomtomme","html_url":"https://github.com/tomtomme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomtomme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomtomme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomtomme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomtomme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomtomme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomtomme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomtomme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomtomme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomtomme/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-05-14t13:56:00z","updated_at":"2013-05-14t13:58:14z","body":"![oc](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4428185/501691/90e8e2ec-bc9d-11e2-9acb-ea1eb19bf7aa.png)\r\n![oc1](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4428185/501693/94a07620-bc9d-11e2-8f2f-66ebbcf8b004.png)\r\n\r\nthe
