interface.\r\n:+1:\r\ni think it would be good to have an interface for contact (and move the delete \r\nmethod in there), which has properties like address (which in itself is an \r\ninterface, modelled after the \"edit address\" form), name (modelled after the \r\n\"edit name\" form), etc.\r\n\r\nhow common is it to use/define collection classes (with iterators) in php?\r\nif you decide to go that way, you probably want addresses as property of contact \r\n(instead of address) and make contacts also a collection
