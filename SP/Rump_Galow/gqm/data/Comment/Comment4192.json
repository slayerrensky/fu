the core problem here are 2 decisions: enabling encryption and opting in to password recovery. i think both have to be done by the same person:\r\n* either itâ€™s an admin choice, and then all accounts are either encrypted or not, and have password recovery or not.\r\n* or itâ€™s a user choice, and then you first have to _opt in_ to encryption.\r\n\r\nbecause this scenario here seems quite strange, where users are basically confronted with: â»hey, you can come on this server, and your data will be encrypted and safe, but when you forget your password all will be lost. if you donâ€™t want to risk that you can give the admin a means of resetting the password. thatâ€™s a potential backdoor, but it still gives protection against other parties â€“ and if you trust your admin everything should be fine.â«\r\n\r\nseems strange to me, hence iâ€™d say both decisions should be done at the same point â€“ either both in the admin settings, or both in the personal settings. admins would have an option to say every user can opt in on their own. but already opting them in to encryption and then just leaving them with the choice about how to cope with security is a subpar solution here."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/21716054","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/4192#issuecomment-21716054","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/4192","id":21716054,"user":{"login":"schiesbn","id":1589737,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/8912b598c7b32dd25b87fd168e0b06b2?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f0a323047dbe8329db30eae8dbe96e55e.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"8912b598c7b32dd25b87fd168e0b06b2","url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn","html_url":"https://github.com/schiesbn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-07-29t12:22:08z","updated_at":"2013-07-29t12:22:08z","body":"@jancborchardt enabling/disabling encryption for individual users is not possible at the moment. i wouldn't go this way, this would open a lot of other problems, e.g. how would you handle file sharing if some users use encryption and some not?\r\n\r\ni would also not like to give the admin the power to decide for all users to enable the recovery key or not. although in some use-cases this can be useful, e.g. think about company policies. but this shouldn't be the general behaviour for personal ownclouds. if it comes to security you always have to make a trade-off between security and convenience. you can't have 100% security and 100% convenience so we need to allow the user to adjust this ratio as it fits.\r\n\r\n@paszczus thinking about it i recognised that we also don't \"warn\" the user during first log-in that he should set a valid email-address in the personal settings to be able to recover his log-in password in case of password loss. so maybe we simply have to expect that a new user will have a look at the settings to see how he can tweak his account? maybe it is also the job of the provider to tell such thinks the user at the beginning, e.g. in case of a service provider in the welcome message. actually he should also inform his user if encryption is enabled and maybe also about some other stuff."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/21728542","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/4192#issuecomment-21728542","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/4192","id":21728542,"user":{"login":"paszczus","id":1582475,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/042a4cbd9a1b7c6c263431cffdd8f9f4?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2fea811cd2f9e78a3e5dc5175435316ddf.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"042a4cbd9a1b7c6c263431cffdd8f9f4","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paszczus","html_url":"https://github.com/paszczus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paszczus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paszczus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paszczus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paszczus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paszczus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paszczus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paszczus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paszczus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paszczus/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-07-29t15:44:22z","updated_at":"2013-07-29t15:44:22z","body":"@schiesbn
