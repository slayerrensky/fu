more or less works.\r\n\r\n- let's say my owncloud runs on https://www.site.com/owncloud\r\n- usually i would access webdav with https://www.site.com/owncloud/remote.php/webdav\r\n- i created another virtual host on 4343 port.\r\n- i configured a http reverse proxy that routes https://www.site.com:4343/owncloud/remote.php/webdav to https://www.site.com/owncloud/remote.php/webdav, with proxy-sendcl variable activated\r\n- then i asked finder to connect to https://www.site.com:4343/owncloud/remote.php/webdav\r\n- i tried upload of a 3.5m mp3 file, and it succeeded. though quite slow.\r\n- of course finder still puts ds store little files. just make a cron job to wipe them out !\r\n\r\nsample conf for the proxy :\r\n\r\nsslproxyengine on\r\n\\<location /owncloud/remote.php/webdav>\r\n    order allow,deny\r\n    allow from all\r\n    setenv proxy-sendcl yes\r\n    proxypass https://www.site.com/owncloud/remote.php/webdav\r\n    proxypassreverse https://www.site.com/owncloud/remote.php/webdav\r\n\\</location>\r\n\r\nof course i wouldn't recommend doing that. poor performance overall, and the http proxy has to configured so that timeouts dont occur.\r\n\r\nbut this proof of concept confirms that this issue is related to how apache/fastcgi badly handles chunked requests from finder dav client. there is nothing to be done to solve that in owncloud or sabredav code.\r\n\r\npeople with a mac can use a different dav client (transmit is very good and works flawlessly), if the server is not supporting finder client. imho close the ticket.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/24430326","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/2010#issuecomment-24430326","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/2010","id":24430326,"user":{"login":"zinkdifferent","id":5345100,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/3129dd0523172187d3d333e963016a1e?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f0aeba268db02fbf1bd595332d4d8c949.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"3129dd0523172187d3d333e963016a1e","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinkdifferent","html_url":"https://github.com/zinkdifferent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinkdifferent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinkdifferent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinkdifferent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinkdifferent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinkdifferent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinkdifferent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinkdifferent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinkdifferent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinkdifferent/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-09-13t23:01:35z","updated_at":"2013-09-13t23:01:35z","body":"stephane,\r\n\r\nwell,
