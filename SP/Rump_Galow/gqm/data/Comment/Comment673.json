spent  a bit time reading through the code of cache, scanner and updater. i like the code. \r\n\r\nhere are some comments:\r\n* please normalize the storage column by creating another table 'storages' and reference an storage-id in the filecache table. that way you could cache the entire storages table in a static var in the modules and have a faster index on the storageid column in the filecache table. you really should do that.\r\n* two directory entries in the table have a size of 0. that smells. is that correct? both are <username>/files\r\n* method checkupdate in watcher.php checks in the database if the entry is a directory or not. does that still work if a file named foo was removed and a directory called foo is created instead, ie. through webdav?\r\n* sorting: in getfoldercontents a order by name statement is used. i am not sure if that is sufficiient. maybe you should add another parameter \"sortorder\" to getfoldercontents which allows more sophisticated setting of sort orders, ie. sorting by size, mime type, also name. if its doable, the database should sort obviously, but for example for file names that is tricky anyway because of localization. \r\n* i have another feature request here: can we add a file id to the table that does never change during life time of a file, also not if it is renamed? that would be the first step to detect renames on server side, which is important for syncing.\r\n\r\ni saw a couple of opportunities to save database selects again, but i think we can fix that later. what i haven't seen or understood is how the new cache is \"embedded\" in the whole system, for example in the sense of update notifications, sharing and stuff. it would be really good to get some basic documentation about that.\r\n\r\nso far for the moment, i hope that makes sense for you. i can do more if it helps."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/11284878","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/673#issuecomment-11284878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/673","id":11284878,"user":{"login":"dragotin","id":1070214,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/af829234b31fb915704c1c65ef48eee0?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f3392afab7f424e10623ba95a941f4d34.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"af829234b31fb915704c1c65ef48eee0","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragotin","html_url":"https://github.com/dragotin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragotin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragotin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragotin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragotin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragotin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragotin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragotin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragotin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dragotin/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-12-12t11:06:02z","updated_at":"2012-12-12t11:06:02z","body":"when
