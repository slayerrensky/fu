few user stories that this can help us resolve:\r\nuser story 1: make it possible for an admin to take an ldap user, find them in the middle of thousands of users, and add them as an admin of owncloud.\r\nuser story 2: make it possible for an admin to manage quota for a specific user, when the users is managed in ldap but the quota is updated or managed separately in owncloud\r\nuser story 3: make it possible for an admin to find a user and make it into a local group admin\r\n\r\nthe real problem seems to be that right now it doesn't scroll dependably, and often users can't be found to turn them into admins on owncloud, to change quota, or to make owncloud specific changes."}]
