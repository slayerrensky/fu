that's the same problem i have with the trash bin tests. i don't know what happens here. if i change the autotest.sh to run multiple times again sqlite it always works. so this is not a general problem with enabling/disabling the encryption app. but why does it work with sqlite and oci but not with mysql and pgsql? why should an simple ```\\oc_app::disable('files_encryption');``` fail on these databases?\r\n\r\nbtw the encryption apps does the same for the trash bin ```\\oc_app::disable('files_trashbin');``` and there everything seems to work.\r\n\r\n@deepdiver1975 jenkins executes more tests in parallel. could it happen that another test enabled the app again in between or are the tests completely isolated?"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/22645386","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/4420#issuecomment-22645386","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/4420","id":22645386,"user":{"login":"deepdiver1975","id":1005065,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/bdba071ed68da9ce8edae53c364902ef?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f67e101ad9531b7d25697b76e503e062e.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"bdba071ed68da9ce8edae53c364902ef","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975","html_url":"https://github.com/deepdiver1975","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepdiver1975/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-14t15:50:25z","updated_at":"2013-08-14t15:50:25z","body":"let
