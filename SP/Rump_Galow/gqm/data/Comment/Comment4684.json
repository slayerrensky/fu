\r\nsatisfied because:\r\n\r\n\r\n* a call to occ --help should already list the available commands, occ list is a pretty unneccessary interaction.\r\n* all the meta-options such as formatting and stuff should not be displayed that prominently. it distracts a lot from the interesting content.\r\n* the really interesting content is way to short. it does not tell what \"rescan filesystem\" actually does, why you want to use it, what consequences it has. on the third page, which is the detailed help about files:scan, it does not show what it does at all. but maybe thats because it is just an example
