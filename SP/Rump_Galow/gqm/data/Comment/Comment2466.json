just an update on this, in my case i was able to resolve this by brining the quota in line with the space that was available.  what was happening, if i did not have enough space available to support the disk space for the two quota for the two users it would simply default to the amount of space on the disk.  once i had enough or exceeded the needed disk on the storage volume, this seemed to cure the issue.  once i made this adjustment the issue went away.  this was just in my particular case, i also upgraded to
