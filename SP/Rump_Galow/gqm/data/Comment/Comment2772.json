doesn't appear to use the \"user_backends\" configuration option... in fact, user_external appears to be the only \"shipped\" authentication app that doesn't call oc_user::userbackend() on class load

and user_openid all call userbackend() on load (when enabled), and so none of them would be impacted when setupbackends isn't correctly called after the class is loaded.  not sure if there's any documentation on this for authentication app writers, but there definitely appears to be a bug in the general handling of authentication classes related to different entry points (some of which require authentication, and don't include it in $runtime_apptypes (or set $runtime_noapps!)\r\n\r\nprobably the correct fix is to:\r\na) audit/fix all entry points to correctly load authentication

owncloud 5.0.11 rc2\r\n\r\ni studied a bit the problem, i come from the related bug https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/1826 . in that bug the problem described here results in the impossibility to authenticate on remote.php to access the contacts if one uses imap authentication, for this reason i believe its important to fix the bug this ticket refers to.\r\n\r\nhere is an analysis and a possible solution.\r\n\r\n*analysis*\r\n\r\noc::init() calls oc_user::setupbackends() before the user_external app is registered. this generates the error message above because the auth apps are not loaded (because the global variable $runtime_noapps is set to true both in remote.php and index.php).\r\n\r\nwhen accessing from index.php the authentication works because in oc::handlerequest(), oc_user::setupbackends() is called again.\r\n\r\nwhen accessing from remote.php oc_user::setupbackends() is not called by the core. it's the task of the each app to setup the auth backends. for instance the contacts app loads the authentication apps in apps/contacts/appinfo/remote.php but it doesn't call oc_user::setupbackends so external authentication doesn't work.\r\n\r\n*possible solution*\r\n\r\none possible solution would be to do this fix in lib/base.php:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nglobal $runtime_noapps;\r\nglobal $runtime_apptypes;\r\nif (!$runtime_noapps) {\r\n        if ($runtime_apptypes) {\r\n                oc_app::loadapps($runtime_apptypes);\r\n        } else {\r\n                oc_app::loadapps();\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n\r\n+ oc_app::loadapps('authentication');\r\n\r\n//setup extra user backends\r\noc_user::setupbackends();\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nand remove all calls to oc_user::setupbackends() elsewhere (also the one in lib/user.php).\r\n\r\nby looking at the source code it seems that this should not open up other issues, but since i'm not familiar with the codebase i might be overlooking something. in particular if there is an entry point to the app that doesn't include the lib/base.php file before using oc_user then in that case auth will not work correctly.\r\n\r\nthe other drawback of this approach is that the authentication apps are loaded even if the request being processed doesn't require authentication, resulting in some unnecessary overhead."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/28400460","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/2772#issuecomment-28400460","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/2772","id":28400460,"user":{"login":"clemenssahs","id":423633,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/27692ae756700d532cfd39d3aced16de?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f942c5b296543573744e3959ad912ec8d.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"27692ae756700d532cfd39d3aced16de","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clemenssahs","html_url":"https://github.com/clemenssahs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clemenssahs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clemenssahs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clemenssahs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clemenssahs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clemenssahs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clemenssahs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clemenssahs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clemenssahs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clemenssahs/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-11-13t14:55:01z","updated_at":"2013-11-13t14:55:01z","body":"has
