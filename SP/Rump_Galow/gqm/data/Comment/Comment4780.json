implement in owncloud.\r\n\r\n2 - anti-brute force measure\r\n\r\ntwo cases :\r\n\r\n2-a you use a reverse proxy for authentication. for example, apache does\r\nthe authentication (using ldap, openid, whatever you like), then gives the\r\nuid to owncloud via authorization headers. this is the best case. apache\r\nlogs info itself about failed auth (basically in serious environments we\r\ntry to have all security stuff in the rp, not in the application : auth,\r\nlog, anti ddos, https, etc)\r\n\r\n2-b you use native owncloud authentication (via form). then apache doesnt\r\nknow when an
