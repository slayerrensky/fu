think there are two schools of thought on interface:\r\na) finder style, eg ajaxplorer\r\nb) dropbox web style (or photo gallery style)\r\n\r\ni think oc goes for the latter, but to do that well needs to excel at that kind of style, ie keep it simple, make it powerful.  one can always put a link to connect via the native operating system finder/explorer to do geeky thing (support seems to be getting better through time)\r\n\r\ni think this chain of thought mainly applies to the highlighting, multi-select, drag and drop, etc all lead naturally to complex finder style interfaces.  a checkbox on the left for selecting and big clickable bars which a default action (and perhaps a thumbnail) are much more \"ios\" style and lend themselves to big clickable actions...\r\n\r\nwith regards to your groupings, i should think these are a simple button up on the nav bar which allow you to \"view by\" and then you choose to view by file name, by date, by size, grouped by category,

like the idea of a more finder like interface. with regard to sharing i cannot stop but think of implementing them as a mountabel storage like for external devices. @icewind1991 @mtgap opinions? then we could mount a share to any path in the file tree we wanted to. currently all shared files can be found in the 'shared' folder which requires special magic to deduplicate filenames when the user has been shared a 'pictures' folder more than once.\r\nmaybe we can use the owner name to distinguish the folders? like\r\n```\r\n/shared/alice/pictures\r\n/shared/bob/pictures\r\n```\r\ninstead of\r\n```\r\n/shared/pictures\r\n/shared/pictures (2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhat should happen when a user alice has the following file hierarchy:\r\n```\r\n/projects/a/docs\r\n/projects/b/docs\r\n...\r\n```\r\nnow alice shares the docs folder of project a to group a and the docs folder of project b to group b.\r\nuser bob happens to be in both groups. he has no way of distinguishing the two folders but that one of them is called 'docs (2)'. \r\n\r\ni guess at least for this case we need some kind of description that users can add to a share.\r\n\r\nor we add something like symlinks so users can link shares into any folder they like. some like to have everythinkg from a project in one place. i know we need to make things 'just work' for non-power users. but then i'd very much like to vote for the google docs approach:\r\n![google docs](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/41/googledocsonchromebook.png)\r\nthis should be a second application (may i suggest to name it 'documents') that does not neet to restrict itself to the historic filesystem limitation of unique filenames and by default shows files ordered by last modified date. \r\nwe already have the *append a number to duplicate shared files* magic which we can reuse when exposing duplicate files via
