code) it's really tedious.\r\nwhat i've found, in lib/files/view.php, in private function basicoperation, filesystem::resolvepath gives the full path without the leading slash ! it seems that the found mountpoint is \"/\". \r\nbut the mkdir function (in local.php) is appending $datadir, which is (for me) \"/home/cloud/owncloud/\", so the system mkdir is ending up with this path : \"/home/cloud/owncloud/home/cloud/owncloud/user/cache\".\r\nof course that doesn't work.\r\nwell, i think i'll try more tomorrow with a fresh install, i might have broke something during my experiments, but i think you really have something wrong with your ldap and files handling
