that i checked it, all the files with zero length are google docs files, created by the google docs web application. all other files have nonzero length (and behave normally), no matter if i upload them to google drive directly or through oc. so one problem that confused me is that files created by the google docs web application are listed as odt/ods files in oc. there is no way to tell from the oc listing if you see an opendocument file or a google docs file except, that the latter ones all have zero lengths (according to my experience). all in all i see two minor bugs:\r\n1. google docs files are listed as opendocument files in oc\r\n2. google docs files have a zero length\r\na don't know the format of google docs files. but chances are little i can do anything with them in oc. so
