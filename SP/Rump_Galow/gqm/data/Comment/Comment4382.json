you guys added those methods without my explicit approval. \r\n\r\nafaik sam was in contact with your regarding this function. but i don't care let's look forward.\r\n\r\n> those aren't methods that should be included in the share api because it's supposed to be generic and not files related.\r\n\r\nthat's a valid argument. you could easily make it generic by adding a parameter, e.g. a array with a list of share types for which kind of shares the function should search for. or put it in the share back-end so that every back-end can provide a suitable implementation. generally i think it would be good to have not only a function which starts with a user and finds all \"file-type\" shared to the user but also the other away around, start at a \"share item\" and find all users with access to it.\r\n\r\n> the tests fail because you didn't write proper unit tests with mocks.\r\n\r\nthis has also an advantage. this way we saw that it will fail in the real world. with a mock everything would look fine and in the real world it would crash because the real share api doesn't provide the same functionality as the mock.\r\n\r\n> from my point of view it looks like recoverfile should be calling
