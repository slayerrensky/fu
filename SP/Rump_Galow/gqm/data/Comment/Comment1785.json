unfortunately it is not that simple. renaming the file will lead several problems:\r\n\r\n- versions will be renamed too, so later they can't be copied over to the trash bin\r\n- other rename hooks will be triggered which might create effects we don't want if a file gets moved to the trash bin\r\n- all post/pre hooks which come after the trash bin hook was executed will fail\r\n- how will the delete operation react if the file is no longer there after executing the pre-hooks?\r\n- the trash bin doesn't get indexed properly by the file cache at the moment, so file ids will not be preserved.\r\n\r\nfor now i would prefer if we concentrate on real show stopper bugs until oc5.0 is out."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/13824841","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/1785#issuecomment-13824841","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/1785","id":13824841,"user":{"login":"icewind1991","id":1283854,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/7c20f90ca5df67dd2cad22a8e2f80d8f?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2fc818423776eba38604496a7caddc0251.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"7c20f90ca5df67dd2cad22a8e2f80d8f","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icewind1991","html_url":"https://github.com/icewind1991","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icewind1991/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icewind1991/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icewind1991/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icewind1991/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icewind1991/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icewind1991/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icewind1991/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icewind1991/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icewind1991/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-02-20t10:20:47z","updated_at":"2013-02-20t10:20:47z","body":"@schiesbn
