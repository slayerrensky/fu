#1871 seems to be the same report. sorry for my short message, i was on the train with my mobile phone. all in all upgrading is quite broken and should be done carefully with lots of backups (we dont have db migrations yet, i think thats the main issue here).\r\n\r\nalso you should update from every minor release to the next minor release, for a complete list see http://owncloud.org/releases/\r\n\r\nmeaning: 4.04 -> 4.05 -> ... etc\r\n\r\nthats the reason for tagging this as duplicate. there are actually quite a variety of other bugs related to updating but we can neither debug this pretty well nor fix them effectively because its a library problem.\r\n\r\nhopefully we can offer a stable way to upgrade after we've switched to doctrine. thanks for your report though
