i could not find anything related and i am still unable to find anything on that.\r\n\r\nactually it is the other way around: it does confuse users if you do not update the shared item names.  please consider the following user story:\r\n\r\na group of people collaborates on a project and uses owncloud for filesync. the project leader creates a folder called \"designs\" and shares it with the project group. later on in the project, it seems that the original folder name does not describe the actual content anymore. therefore he renames it to \"mockups\" and adds some documents to the folder for his project group to look at. because every other change does propagate to everybody, he assumes that the folder is renamed for everybody as well. he send out an email to his group saying \"hey, i added some new files to the 'mockups' folder. please have look at them and provide feedback\". the group however is totally confused what he is talking about as they don't see the folder mentioned.\r\n\r\nthis is not something i made up but a real story. something like this did happen inside my employers company.\r\n\r\nit is inconsistent that every changed file / renamed file inside a folder does propagate, but not the base shared item itself. it is the point of owncloud to keep everything up to date automatically after all.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/25080496","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/4521#issuecomment-25080496","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/4521","id":25080496,"user":{"login":"frisco82","id":487098,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/a20ee2cef4622e8a67d9402ecb367f4b?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2fa7abc00a60c19610dde8abf077f754e8.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"a20ee2cef4622e8a67d9402ecb367f4b","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frisco82","html_url":"https://github.com/frisco82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frisco82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frisco82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frisco82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frisco82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frisco82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frisco82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frisco82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frisco82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frisco82/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-09-25t12:03:43z","updated_at":"2013-09-25t12:03:43z","body":"+1 to this.\r\nevery cloud sharing service update the file names as the original file changes.\r\nindeed it works as it should with files inside shared folders, you can change the original file and it changes on the shared with end."}]
