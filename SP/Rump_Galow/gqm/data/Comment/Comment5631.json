properly retaining the directory structure was also a plan. also see how dropbox visualizes the deleted files as not being a separate trash bin but being inside the file system as greyed out files. i actually think that is a much better model and easier to understand for people.\r\n\r\nso for now this is expected behavior. anything we would want to do for owncloud 7 though?"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/27432184","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/5631#issuecomment-27432184","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/5631","id":27432184,"user":{"login":"vicdeo","id":991300,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/57b8c1e26d502d5414e4b2fb875d2994?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2fe8357fefe8bad5436de368fa5a419461.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"57b8c1e26d502d5414e4b2fb875d2994","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo","html_url":"https://github.com/vicdeo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicdeo/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-10-30t19:45:08z","updated_at":"2013-10-30t19:45:08z","body":"related to https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/2193"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/27441579","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/5631#issuecomment-27441579","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/5631","id":27441579,"user":{"login":"schiesbn","id":1589737,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/8912b598c7b32dd25b87fd168e0b06b2?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f0a323047dbe8329db30eae8dbe96e55e.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"8912b598c7b32dd25b87fd168e0b06b2","url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn","html_url":"https://github.com/schiesbn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-10-30t21:37:52z","updated_at":"2013-10-30t21:41:28z","body":"we restore the file in the previous folder if the folder still exists. if not we restore the file to the root. the reason: imagine you have a quite nested file structure like \"/foo/bar/foobar/2013/02/15\", now you delete a file from this folder. later you remove the complete folder \"foo\". now you want to restore one file from \"/foo/bar/foobar/2013/02/15\". do you really want to re-create all the ghost folders just to restore one single file? moving the file out of the hierarchy again is also quite some work in the web ui once the \"ghost folders\" are created. i think in most cases people will just restore the single file and access it directly. if they want to restore the complete tree than they can do this too."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/27441755","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/5631#issuecomment-27441755","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/5631","id":27441755,"user":{"login":"schiesbn","id":1589737,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/8912b598c7b32dd25b87fd168e0b06b2?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f0a323047dbe8329db30eae8dbe96e55e.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"8912b598c7b32dd25b87fd168e0b06b2","url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn","html_url":"https://github.com/schiesbn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schiesbn/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-10-30t21:40:14z","updated_at":"2013-10-30t21:43:41z","body":"i close this issue for now because that's the intended behaviour and was already discussed before. what happens with oc7 where we want to drop some special purpose folders like shared and maybe also the seperated trash bin is a different topic and will be discussed at the right time."}]
