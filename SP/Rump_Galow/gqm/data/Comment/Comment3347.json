don't see any problem we had before. it seems this pr has been opened 5 months ago so there might have been quite a few changes since then.\r\n\r\non master/oc6 the current dir of the user is kept in the url (and uses a special schema/handling for ie8 with hashchange/history api) so i don't see why we'd need to additionally store it in the session.\r\n\r\ni'm not sure we'd want the user to automatically land on the last used directory when opening the files app directly, either by clicking on the \"files\" icon or opening the default url (http://host/owncloud/). this might surprise users as it means the current url doesn't point to a specific page/dir consistently.\r\n\r\nkeeping the last/recent dir could be achieved with a \"list of recently used dirs\" which might fit in the left panel suggested in https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/1936 so the user can quickly navigate back to the last used x folders.\r\n\r\nalso, this pr might mess up with the ie8 workarounds
