i imagine is the following: as admin, you get a new setting option below users and groups, called \"workspaces\" for example. the page looks the same as the one for users and groups, except that you create workspaces and assign users and groups to it(with read-write settings). you get the possibility to set an admin (group admin or individual) for managing the members of the space and their rights and give the space a quota.\r\nthe space is than mounted in the member's root with a special folder-symbol and the workspace admin(s) can share it with others, so they get added.\r\n\r\nas it is a way to give more diskspace to a special group on your server, i think this should stay in the hands of the admin. the others can just use their own quota and share with the common share option, maybe it is an idea to allow them to raise a shared folder into their root to build an unmanaged project group with a shared folder.\r\n\r\nmy field of use is an association which has limited diskspace but wants to empower its
