not sure what's the right behavior in this case. should be display the size of the (encrypted) file or the size of the content (unencrypted size). if we show the unencrypted size it could also lead to confusions if the user tries to recalculate his used quota. because the calculation of the used space based on what he see in the file view will differ on what the quota management will tell you. for
