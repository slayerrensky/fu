moving an entity (file or folder) to another folder effectively changes the mtime of the parent folder that hosts the move operation. no mtime changes on the moved entitiy (i'm ok with that, shouldn't i?) . after the move operation the web interface still presents the moved folder even if the parent folder has mtime changed. clicking through this zombie entity brings you to the index dir (like clicking on the files button) as i stated before. going to the destination of the moved entity makes you able to see and interact with the moved entity, so it has refreshed the informations to make you see those changes. seems like it does not invalidate the cache of the parent folder hosting the operations. please, feel free to ask me to do other tests."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/22104228","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/1645#issuecomment-22104228","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/1645","id":22104228,"user":{"login":"jancborchardt","id":925062,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f84ec51f9ceed468217d4e13abf78da9c.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt","html_url":"https://github.com/jancborchardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-05t12:58:26z","updated_at":"2013-08-05t12:58:26z","body":"i’m
