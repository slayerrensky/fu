and we collect the file list, someone opens a random folder and we check the share status to display the icons). if the share is expired we remove it from the database and doesn't return the content, doesn't include it in the files-list for the accessed shared folder or doesn't add the share icon. this way we make sure that nobody will be able to access a expired share, the icons will be always up-to-date and that the database will be cleaned-up in a adequate time frame without the need of a cron.\r\n\r\nregarding the date-picker, it would be nice to grey out dates in the past. but afaik we use a third-party date-picker so i'm not sure if this can be done easily. if we just silently remove the share if the user chooses a expire date in the past this could be quite irritating, because the
