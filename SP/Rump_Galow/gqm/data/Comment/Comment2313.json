12:32 you\r\nseems like there is a problem with your implementation of lastpass under chrome.\r\n\r\nfor more information please see https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/2313#issuecomment-14912803\r\n\r\n2013-03-21 12:04 sameer\r\nunlike some other browsers, chrome doesn't have a built in notification bar at the top of the browser that developers can take advantage of.\r\nso instead, we have to inject one into the page using some javascript.\r\nin the screenshot in the ticket, i believe this is the issue.\r\nthere is an 'autofill (19)' lastpass notification bar present that causes the entire page to pushed down.\r\nwhen the text label is shown, it is shown at the wrong position as a result.\r\n\r\nthere are a few workarounds:\r\n1) you can simply click the x on the lastpass notification bar to make it disapeear and retry\r\nor\r\n2) you can permanently disable notification bars for lastpass (lastpass icon -> preferences -> notifications)\r\nor\r\n3) within their software, the position can be calculated correctly just prior to being shown.\r\n\r\nthanks."}]
