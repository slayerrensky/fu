is a second point i want to make regarding this issue:\r\nfrom my point-of-view you have done a major change in the interface by replacing controls and changing the way how this feature works. such a change should definitely result into another version of owncloud, e.g. \"oc 5.1\".\r\nwith only having little knoweldge of what's inside the version (by reading the release notes) i would consider a change from 5.0.10 to 5.0.11 rather being a bug-fixing version. but this is definitely more. and it results into major problems.\r\n\r\nand it is not the first time. another example is this: https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/4323\r\n\r\nthis also was a major change. and it was packed into a little version step somewhere between 5.0.7 and 5.0.9.\r\n\r\nfrom my perspective you should really discuss the way you make version steps. big changes especially in the interface and changes inside workflows should not be labelled like a bug-fixing release.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/24299454","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/4802#issuecomment-24299454","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/4802","id":24299454,"user":{"login":"kiranos","id":840871,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/45bcfc648c1ed90ebadd23a484d99376?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2fb2013959ac9cf127c7f4a02a6bf3cde1.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"45bcfc648c1ed90ebadd23a484d99376","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranos","html_url":"https://github.com/kiranos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranos/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-09-12t07:20:15z","updated_at":"2013-09-12t07:20:15z","body":"@hanibal8
