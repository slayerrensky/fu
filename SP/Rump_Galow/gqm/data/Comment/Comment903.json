we are already loading routes. that could be generalized as a loader script performing any actions that should be done before an app is loaded, while at the same time providing visual feedback.\r\ni have no idea if this is viable though.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/11437590","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/903#issuecomment-11437590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/903","id":11437590,"user":{"login":"randolfcarter","id":2631274,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/e4a5d1c2c314d59e880d83b497a0d719?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f3c3d7236785996f9e5f172ea5cdac91b.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"e4a5d1c2c314d59e880d83b497a0d719","url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolfcarter","html_url":"https://github.com/randolfcarter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolfcarter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolfcarter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolfcarter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolfcarter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolfcarter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolfcarter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolfcarter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolfcarter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolfcarter/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-12-17t11:02:53z","updated_at":"2012-12-17t11:03:01z","body":"probably related to https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/96. haven't researched that one further, though, since it didn't happen so drastically anymore...."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/11989345","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/903#issuecomment-11989345","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/903","id":11989345,"user":{"login":"lukasreschke","id":878997,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/f080e75d370a4d8e550983a4898bcf3b?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2ff12e47d5bb5359a9f58e8217413be790.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"f080e75d370a4d8e550983a4898bcf3b","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasreschke","html_url":"https://github.com/lukasreschke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasreschke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasreschke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasreschke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasreschke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasreschke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasreschke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasreschke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasreschke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasreschke/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-01-08t09:01:09z","updated_at":"2013-01-08t09:01:09z","body":"resolved by #1079."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/11989374","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/903#issuecomment-11989374","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/903","id":11989374,"user":{"login":"randolfcarter","id":2631274,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/e4a5d1c2c314d59e880d83b497a0d719?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f3c3d7236785996f9e5f172ea5cdac91b.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"e4a5d1c2c314d59e880d83b497a0d719","url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolfcarter","html_url":"https://github.com/randolfcarter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolfcarter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolfcarter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolfcarter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolfcarter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolfcarter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolfcarter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolfcarter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolfcarter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolfcarter/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-01-08t09:02:08z","updated_at":"2013-01-08t09:02:08z","body":"really looking forward to that one :dancers: "}]
