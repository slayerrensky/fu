\r\ni got the same symptoms like laurent wandrebeck. \r\nblank page when accessing owncloud... same error status in ssl_error_log, same error line in db.php... i was using mysql instead of postgreysql for login\r\n\r\nas it was an error in the db.php i just check the status of the database application. as i guest the mysql server process had been killed and no process was running.. i just started the database server (mysqld) and then everything was ok. \r\n\r\ni'm not an expertise in php but i believe as the database connection was failed, the application  is keep on trying to connect to the database.."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/22107491","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/1267#issuecomment-22107491","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/1267","id":22107491,"user":{"login":"jancborchardt","id":925062,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f84ec51f9ceed468217d4e13abf78da9c.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt","html_url":"https://github.com/jancborchardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-05t13:56:19z","updated_at":"2013-08-05t13:56:19z","body":"iâ€™m closing this bug because it has been inactive for a few months. this probably means itâ€™s not reproducible or it has been fixed in a newer version.\r\n\r\nplease reopen if the error still persists with owncloud 5.0.9 (the latest stable version) and then please use the [issue template](https://raw.github.com/owncloud/core/master/issue_template.md). you an also contribute directly by providing a patch â€“ see the [developer manual](http://doc.owncloud.org/server/5.0/developer_manual/). :)\r\n\r\nthank you!"}]
