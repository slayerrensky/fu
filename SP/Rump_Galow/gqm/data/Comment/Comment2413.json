what happens here is exactly how it is supposed to. \r\nyou are using the display name as ldap username. the internally used username is created from the uuid.  \r\nthe right solution is not to doctor around in files_external. the display name is supposed to be a non-unique, non-permanent name. \r\n\r\nthe correct solution would be to override the creation of the username. this is not there yet,
