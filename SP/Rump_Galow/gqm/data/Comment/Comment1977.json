@deepdiver1975 so i had a look on a fresh install (this is where it fails) and the database creation process just stops when it attempts to create in index on the name field of the oc_fscache table so this is before any data is populated.  it looks like the allowed characters for this field (300) is too long for creation of an index in mysql.  so in order to fox it the script that creates the database needs to reduce the allowable size of this field (which i think we could bring this down from 300) or we need to skip the index (which would impact performance).  i have worked around this error by letting configuration run, after i get this error, i log into the database (and you can see it stopped at oc_fscache) and i changed the max length of name from 300 to 150 then run the config again and all works ok!! so if we change the max length of name to 150 this should fix the issue without any rela usability problems!!"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/14480659","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/1977#issuecomment-14480659","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/1977","id":14480659,"user":{"login":"bboule","id":3329523,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/4b5a255289276c6eb3b5e011ff9b289c?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2fd66a5a39e175e4864b06648907ba39e5.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"4b5a255289276c6eb3b5e011ff9b289c","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bboule","html_url":"https://github.com/bboule","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bboule/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bboule/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bboule/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bboule/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bboule/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bboule/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bboule/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bboule/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bboule/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-03-06t03:29:15z","updated_at":"2013-03-06t03:29:15z","body":"what
