should we continue here?\r\n\r\nit seems like at the moment \\oc\\files\\view() doesn't check if the path exists and doesn't try to create it. i think this check and path creation should be done in \\oc\\files\\view() so that the public api can just forward the request to the internal api. of course this wouldn't solve the problem described in the comments of the code. but it would allow us to get the public api into master. in another step we can still think about if and how we should do the check and path creation in \\oc\\files\\view(). what do you think @icewind1991

changes provide a new architecture for the filesystem described [here](https://gist.github.com/icewind1991/dbf256a7a8da3e41c905), you can still use the view based api but using the new api will probably be better in the long run.\r\n\r\na bigger change for the encryption app is that those changes will remove the fileproxy system in favor of storage wrapper (see [this
