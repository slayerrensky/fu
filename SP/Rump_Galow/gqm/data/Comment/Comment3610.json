yes, that's true. i already added some additional text to the password reset page which explains the situation (https://github.com/owncloud/core/commit/58fd76607b3b874ecf9d852e9cc3dd95504a8fb8#core/lostpassword/templates)\r\n\r\nto decrypt your files you need the correct password. by default only the user has this password, it's his log-in password. so if he loses his password he will loss access to his data. in the personal settings the user can change his password and this will also update the encryption password. but therefore he needs to know his old password.\r\n\r\nif the recovery password is enabled than there is a second user who can change your password and update your encryption keys, namely the admin who knows the recovery password. this is done in the admin user settings. at the top the admin can enter the recovery key and than change the users password. this will change both, the user log-in password and the users encryption password.\r\n\r\nthe password recovery functionality which is offered you at the log-in screen. can't recover your files since it neither knows your old log-in password nor the recovery password.\r\n\r\nthis means that once you loses your password you have to ask the admin to reset the password for you, that's the only way your files can be recovered. the admin can also do this after you already reset your password by
