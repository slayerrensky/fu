(in #698 we don't get the timestamp from the database but from mtime on the fly. if i understand correctly... sry, my english is bad :p)\r\nso i think the problem is based on database and not only bounded to the top folders. i think the other issue (#138) could be the same problem, like this issue. but i don't know... (i haven't checked the owncloud architecture in details till now ;) )\r\n\r\nby the way, most of the changed files (filesize: 0byte) are history-files which do not exist (i checked the path)... so i deleted them from mysql... that was a bad idea... the existing files in the same folder will not displayed in this folder now... (maybe because the history-files were from this files. sorry, i don't know - haven't done a backup :( ) the files are still on the server but i think i must upload them again..."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/11110095","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/749#issuecomment-11110095","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/749","id":11110095,"user":{"login":"jancborchardt","id":925062,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f84ec51f9ceed468217d4e13abf78da9c.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"2fd3f4d5d762955e5b603794a888fa97","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt","html_url":"https://github.com/jancborchardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jancborchardt/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-12-06t22:55:43z","updated_at":"2012-12-06t22:55:43z","body":"@icewind1991 any idea on this, or who could know?"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/11135676","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/749#issuecomment-11135676","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/749","id":11135676,"user":{"login":"icewind1991","id":1283854,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/7c20f90ca5df67dd2cad22a8e2f80d8f?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2fc818423776eba38604496a7caddc0251.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"7c20f90ca5df67dd2cad22a8e2f80d8f","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icewind1991","html_url":"https://github.com/icewind1991","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icewind1991/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icewind1991/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icewind1991/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icewind1991/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icewind1991/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icewind1991/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icewind1991/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icewind1991/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icewind1991/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-12-07t16:16:35z","updated_at":"2012-12-07t16:16:35z","body":"@jancborchardt i have no idea why the size of individual files can be wrong"}]
