the same light of this bug, one from bugzilla: manual \"scanfiles()\" on javascript-console doesnt update folder-sizes\r\n\r\nhttp://bugs.owncloud.org/thebuggenie/owncloud/issues/oc-2112\r\n\r\nseems there may be a bug in scanfiles(true)\r\n\r\ndescription:\r\nafter syncing my files per samba/robocopy, i had to clear my fscache (parent=-1 bug) and rescan the filesystem by calling scanfiles() from a javascript console. \r\n\r\nall files where displayed correctly now in webinterface, but every folder had the size of only the contained files, not including the contained subfolders (so a folder with _only_ subfolders was shown with 0 bytes). \r\n\r\nproblem: lib/filecache.php - function increasesize() calls self::getparentid with $path, not regarding the needed fullpath \r\n\r\nworks fine for me (not sure how this whole github-thingy works, so i just post it here): \r\n348     while($id!=-1 && strlen($path) > 0) {//walk up the filetree increasing the size of all parent folders\r\n(...)\r\n351       $path=dirname($path);\r\n352       $id=self::getid($path,$root);\r\n\r\n\r\ninstead of \r\n\r\n348     while($id!=-1) {//walk up the filetree increasing the size of all parent folders\r\n(...)\r\n351       $id=self::getparentid($path);\r\n352       $path=dirname($path);\r\nif the strlen isnt checked, the routine wont stop trying to get the parent of \"empty string\"...i wasn't able to find out why id!=-1 wasnt enough. \r\n\r\nstill a problem: scanfiles() for a specific folder: each call increases the size of parent-folders of the folder to scan. \r\n\r\nexample: \r\n\r\nfoo      300mb\r\nfoo/foo  150mb\r\nfoo/bar  150mb\r\n \r\nwill be after scanfiles(true,'foo/bar');\r\n \r\nfoo      450mb\r\nfoo/foo  150mb\r\nfoo/bar  150mb\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreproduction steps:\r\nclear fscache in your database\r\nrescan by javascript scanfiles(true)\r\nfolder-sizes arent updated recursivly (so a folder containing only folders, and no files, will be 0 bytes)"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/16005964","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/440#issuecomment-16005964","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/440","id":16005964,"user":{"login":"bartv2","id":2227877,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/c2d86a0a66a4be2c904e24034e842f44?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f05e8b1362feb118a386dfd282b20fb84.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"c2d86a0a66a4be2c904e24034e842f44","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartv2","html_url":"https://github.com/bartv2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartv2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartv2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartv2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartv2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartv2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartv2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartv2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartv2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartv2/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-04-06t23:19:34z","updated_at":"2013-04-06t23:19:34z","body":"can
