the code checker is skipped on windows, so apps that use oc internal classes will only work on windows.  amusing that this may increase our windows market share!\r\n\r\ni think i must echo @kabum's concerns.  there are a few reasons not to perform this check at all:\r\n\r\n1. the grep code is too prone to false positives and is sketchy.\r\n\r\n2. improving the checker to account for its deficiencies would decrease its performance.\r\n\r\n3. the infrequency of use and outlier nature of the checker code suggests a lack of maintainability and increase in code bloat.\r\n\r\n4. allowing acceptable code use to differ between platforms seems unwise.\r\n\r\n5. without the checker code, app reliability remains enforceable by policy.\r\n\r\nthe reason to enforce public api use is to ensure app reliability. but we haven't had a public api for long enough to allow app authors to adjust.  suddenly disabling the use of any app that doesn't conform to something that we just invented seems abrupt.  i suggest we do the following instead:\r\n\r\n1. publicly announce the deprecation of the use of internal classes with the release of oc6.\r\n\r\n2. adjust the app store so that new submissions are scanned for private class use, and publish warnings with those apps that they are not compatible with the public api.  this does not need to happen immediately, but prior to oc7's release.\r\n\r\n3. remove the code checker from oc6 core, or barring that, allow the activation of those apps that fail the check, but with a log message indicating the failure.\r\n\r\n4. with oc7, break support for deprecated apps, remove the checker, and refer broken app users to documentation concerning the need to use updated apps.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/30138280","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/5929#issuecomment-30138280","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/5929","id":30138280,"user":{"login":"kabum","id":245432,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/a1dea19f88f38ea0b5b5b4d19d5b3107?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f53d8cbb3dbc087a02951dec47438ccdf.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"a1dea19f88f38ea0b5b5b4d19d5b3107","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kabum","html_url":"https://github.com/kabum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kabum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kabum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kabum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kabum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kabum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kabum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kabum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kabum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kabum/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-12-09t15:00:14z","updated_at":"2013-12-09t15:00:14z","body":":+1:
