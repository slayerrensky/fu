1., 2. and 3.: i fully understand that this addition means more work to support and maintain for the owncloud team. i didn't especially like the idea of putting it into the core either. i also considered @karlitschek's idea of creating an own app, but that's not an ideal solution. this means having multiple copies of various files that generally provide the same functionality, and in the worst case they are on different versions and patch levels.\r\n\r\na perfect solution would be an extendable files_external plugin, where the different backends are hosted as \"standalone\" apps, which simply integrate into the core plugin. this would allow easier integration of new backends (which is your concern no. 3) and it would also take the burden of supporting and maintaining them away from the core developers.\r\n\r\nto 4.: i can't really follow this objection, because the files_external plugin already allows, for example, \"owncloud hosted by amazon s3\". i don't simply see this plugin's purpose as a way to quickly access one or two files on one's dropbox account, but more as a way to productively integrate external storage providers.\r\n\r\nanyway, thank you all for the
