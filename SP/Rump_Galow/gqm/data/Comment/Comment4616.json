have done like you said, overwritten /myserver/owncloud/lib/base with the file i've downloaded, removed sessions from /var/lib/php5 and cleared all cookies, from my ipad's safari -from wich i ran in to this snag in the first place-, even gave apache a reboot for good measure. i logged in with my username starting with a capital letter and saw my regular files, i then logged out to log in again, this time with my regular name, and that also worked like it aught to. gave my server a reboot, and tried it twice again, that also went well :) thanks guys! i'ma happy camper.\r\n\r\non a sidenote: could it be that this base.php file has changed between versions of oc? because i use it for rather a long time, and i can imagine this hapening lot's of times before (loggin in from ipad with username starting with capital letter). but this \"flaw\" came much later.\r\n\r\nalso, am i correct in assuming that this fix for issue 4616 will be part of oc 5.0.11? and, lastly, how come virgin lamp systems (like my virtual sys, and another one that i set up for a friend in sweden) don't seem to suffer from this flaw (yet)? \r\n\r\nanyway, again, thank you very much dudes, this was something
