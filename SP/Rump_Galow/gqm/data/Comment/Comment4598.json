occasional behaviour here : connection to webdav is suddently stalled,\ntransfers stop, and finally everything timeouts. especially with windows\nand macosx builtin clients. i spent quite some time investigating,\nparticularly the several fastcgi timeouts (in apache 2.4 mod_proxy_fcgi and\nin php) with no real success. logs are not helpful. i just see that some\nphp process childs die in a suspect manner, and sometimes a restart of\nphp-fpm process is necessary. to sum it up, ive not be able to decide if\nroot cause lies in owncloud, php, apache, mod_prxy_fcgi, my configuration,\nor everybody :(\n\n(incidently, i would not recommend apache 2.4 + mod_proxy_fcgi for\nowncloud. its doesnt respect correctly the fastcgi spec about request,\npath_info, script_name and so on, so deploying owncloud requires a bit of\nnonsense patching of lib/request.php. i'm considering delegating owncloud\nto a nginx instance.)\n\nregards,\nstephane"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/23398488","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/4598#issuecomment-23398488","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/4598","id":23398488,"user":{"login":"karlitschek","id":867445,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/87ce2b4531ee1a0c32b50e0d8f049224?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f06e7098636caebfc9c30c9f52eb905df.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"87ce2b4531ee1a0c32b50e0d8f049224","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek","html_url":"https://github.com/karlitschek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlitschek/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-28t08:24:47z","updated_at":"2013-08-28t08:24:47z","body":"the
