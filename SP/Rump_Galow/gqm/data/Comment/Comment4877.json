the shares for a given file/folder) \r\n  - post create new share\r\n\r\n- /share/shareid\r\n  - get get information about the specific share\r\n  - put updates the specific share\r\n  - delet delete

actually the same use case as we have today in the webui:\r\n>we list all files and folders and display the share status on each of them.\r\n\r\n> clients/api users want to do the same and instead of firing on call for each file/folder they fire one call to get all.\r\n\r\ni agree. i added another parameter to get /shares with ```/shares?file=foo&subfiles=yes``` you will get a list of all shares
