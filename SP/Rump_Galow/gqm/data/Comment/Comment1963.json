also sanitizing objects is a very intransparent process. if you want to sanitize your output do it by using p() like described in the documentation. not sanitizing your output and relying on a weird

feeling of security. (e.g. the \"key\" is not sanitized in arrays which lead to a recent xss)\r\n\r\ni'd really like to get rid of this auto sanitization and tell every developer to just use `p()` instead of  `echo()` - i know that it's kinda late for that now but better to do it now than forgetting it and never doing it ;-) \r\n(this would also make it *a lot* easier to track potential xss vulnerabilities since you just have to check for usages of insecure functions) \r\n\r\nwe even forbid the usage of `echo` in our documentation and it's kinda confusing to use it in core + our core apps then.\r\n\r\n> to prevent xss the following php functions for printing are forbidden: echo, print() and <?=. instead use the p() function for printing your values. should you require unescaped printing, double check for xss and use: print_unescaped.\r\nhttp://doc.owncloud.org/server/5.0/developer_manual/app/templates.html\r\n\r\ni could do the changes on core + apps on friday afternoon -
