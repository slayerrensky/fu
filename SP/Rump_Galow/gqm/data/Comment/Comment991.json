latest master in and see if it still works\r\n* change color of progress bar from crazy orange to a slightly darker grey than the row normally is\r\n* remove the global progress bar on the top right.

colums as present in the other rows i'd like to add a row spanning all columns. that will not only allow us to add a progress bar over the whole table, but also visually distinguish it from already existing files. it also makes it easier to not show file actions like 'rename', 'share' and 'history' until the upload is complete, saving us the effort to take care of a lot of corner cases.\r\n\r\nalso postponig to oc7"}]
