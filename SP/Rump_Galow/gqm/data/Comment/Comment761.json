an ad-hoc solution to delete a spooky file entry\r\n\r\nas reported, the problem i had was that my server file repository listed a *spooky* *file* in the directory listing of a shared folder when visited with my firefox browser (web client).\r\n\r\n```\r\n/gemeinsame dateien t/file.pdf.v1234567890\r\n```\r\n\r\nby the way, the file.pdf was actually a filename with spaces and two umlauts.\r\n\r\nwith *spooky* i mean, that the file was definitely not existing, neither on the server nor on any of the connected clients.\r\n\r\nad-hoc solution, and perhaps - developers, heads up! - a way to find the lurking problem in the sync and database software:\r\n\r\nit was not possible to delete or rename the file - because there were no action links. see my comment https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/761#issuecomment-15251567 , \r\n\r\n\r\nso i had the idea to\r\n\r\n#### rename the whole shared folder\r\nto \r\n```\r\n/gemeinsame dateien t2/\r\n```\r\n(the spooky file was already gone !)\r\n\r\n* and vice versa, renaming it to its old name\r\n\r\n```\r\n/gemeinsame dateien t/\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe costs were \r\n\r\n* some synchronised files after step 1 and \r\n* some synchronised files after step 2\r\n\r\nso that the old status was restored after a while.\r\n\r\nnow everything looks fine. the ghost disappeared from the host...\r\n"}]
