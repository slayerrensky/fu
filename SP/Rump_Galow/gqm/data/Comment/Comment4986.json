that's still an issue.\r\n\r\nfor oc6 we have a improved error handling to catch such situation.\r\n\r\n- we can still share the file.\r\n- if the recipient tries to open the file he gets a message similar like \"the file isn't encrypted for you, ask the ower to reshare the file with you\".\r\n\r\nwe use this for the initial migration, because we don't want to remove all shares which can't be encrypted to all recipient during migration.\r\n\r\nthis means that i could also remove the current check which blocks sharing if the key is not available. the result would be that sharing would always be possible. but if the recipient doesn't have a public key at this point in time he will get the message mentioned above if he tries to open the shared file.\r\n\r\n@tilllt \r\n> users logging in later should have the group shares on \"hold\" until their filebase is encrypted. once they made the transition, the files should be made available to them.\r\n\r\nunfortunately it is not that easy. because the problem is not, that the filebase of the recipient needs to be encrypted. the problem is that we need the public key from the recipient to encrypt the file to him. if this doesn't happen during the share operation there are only two situation where we can encrypt the file to him:\r\n\r\n- if the file (or a parent) folder gets reshared after the recipient created his key pair\r\n- if the file gets edited and the  recipient created his key pair in the meantime.\r\n\r\nbecause to encrypt the file to a additional recipient we first need to decrypt it. this can only be done by a user with access to the file.\r\nbut the solution i described above should work and i will probably implement it for oc6"}]
