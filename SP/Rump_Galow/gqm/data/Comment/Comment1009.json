right, will do. can't report though if it helped, i've been running owncloud for about 2 months until this error occured.\r\n\r\nedit: wow, that was easy. same error again, just a few hours later.\r\ni'm posting some entries from my apache error.log now... it al started with several thousand lines of these:\r\n\r\n\t[sun dec 23 17:23:31 2012] [error] [client 46.x.x.x] client denied by

the following messages a few hundred times in exactly this order:\r\n\r\n\t[sun dec 23 20:13:09 2012] [error] [client 92.x.x.x] php warning:  popen(file -i -b

and the server failed (again).\r\nafter that, i got the classic from above, which polluted my error.log with about 300 lines of error logs per second.\r\n\r\n\t[sun dec 23 20:24:32 2012] [error]
