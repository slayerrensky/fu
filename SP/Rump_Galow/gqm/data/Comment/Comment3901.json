was also causing some other issues (owncloud crashed when viewing elster files, roundcubemail crashed when uploading files), so i investigated further. turns out, it was a problem with the `file` package of my gentoo system.\r\n\r\ndowngrading `sys-apps/file` from version `5.12` to `5.11` solved all issues including this zero byte behavior.\r\n\r\nhttps://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=64836\r\nhttps://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=471682\r\n\r\ni think this patch is unnecessary then.\r\nthanks for your quick responses."}]
