via eg the personal administration and/or a \"identifyer\" next beside search on top right.\r\n3.) during a search, a small \"identifyer\" that a search is running should appear, maybe on top right next beside search. this identifyer should disappear automatically when finished. via this identifyer, the popup can be opened/closed.\r\n4.) during a scan, search can be disabled if this is a necessary condition\r\n5.) there should be a difference in the scanning behaviour if a drive is a assigned to a single user only or to a group or multiple users.\r\n\r\ni do not know if, but for me it
