i was able to delete from dropbox with the latest builds (mar 5 5.0.0). the basic case works where i delete a file in owncloud, it is removed from dropbox.  i can also create folders and upload files

server too.  but, owncloud still thinks the file is there and doesn't delete it from owncloud itself.\r\n\r\nserver log:\r\nerror \tfiles_external \terror: (400) path must not be empty \tmarch 6, 2013
