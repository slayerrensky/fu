\"log_query\" called \"log_sql_separate\" (or whatever, true/false) to seperate the sql statements from owcloud.log. this would be helpful to read oc related messages separated from sql statements. the filename could be set fixed and not changeable by the admin (like owncloud_sql.log).\r\nthis would also be helpful when you collect logs centrally because you can decide what to
