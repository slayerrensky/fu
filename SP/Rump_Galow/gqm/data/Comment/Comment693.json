window and click on one of the group selects.\r\ni haven't pushed the changes in contacts app yet, because it depends on this pr.\r\n\r\n> stupid question: are these changes 'only' needed by the contacts app?\r\n\r\ngood question :-) for now yes mostly, but they also solve two problems in settings/users: if you click on a multiselect near the bottom, the dropdown would be partly hidden, and it adds a scrollbar if the are more than 10-15 groups, which fixes issue #702. i could make the number configurable btw.\r\nand it makes it more generally usable. without these changes it was only usable for selects that used the same value in the options value and label, which for the most parts isn't the case. also the plugin didn't properly update the underlying select.\r\n\r\n@jancborchardt [asked me to use this plugin](https://github.com/owncloud/apps/issues/244#issuecomment-10814408) for adding address books, and i will probably also use it for adding
