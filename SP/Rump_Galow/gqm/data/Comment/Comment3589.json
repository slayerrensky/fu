already looking into a infinite scroll implementation. this will also be useful for the normal file view, which also becomes quite slow for a large number of files.\r\n\r\ngenerally i must say that i'm a little bit surprised that people have that many single files in the trash bin since if you delete a huge folder you will only have one entry for the given folder. you could also set 'trashbin_retention_obligation' in your config.php to a lower value (e.g. 30) to remove old files in the trash more frequently (default is 180 days which might be a little bit to high, maybe i will adjust the value for oc6)."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/18967879","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/3589#issuecomment-18967879","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/3589","id":18967879,"user":{"login":"smiddy","id":4051014,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/ac9f3b1e8b002e099c8af320a555053c?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f2c55551ecddeac019b3918c932774d99.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"ac9f3b1e8b002e099c8af320a555053c","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiddy","html_url":"https://github.com/smiddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smiddy/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-06-05t10:39:19z","updated_at":"2013-06-05t10:39:19z","body":"i
