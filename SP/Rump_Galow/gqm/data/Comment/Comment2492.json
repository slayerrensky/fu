unsure if any of them are actually related because i've not seen the exact behavior reported in those issues. i experienced a second \"dos\" type take-down today as a result of mysqld today. the system had run stable for roughly 16 hours. i restarted the mysqld daemon last night at about 7pm est and i had to restart it again today at about 12:30pm est. i checked the logs but apparently /var/log was full from having accidentally left apache in debug mode and my myql query log was empty as a result of no disk space left in /var. i have resolved that issue and am now successfully logging the mysql queries. i will update again with some specific information about what mysqld and apache are doing when they are using abnormally high system resources."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/15255888","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/2492#issuecomment-15255888","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/2492","id":15255888,"user":{"login":"k4k","id":524645,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/d2370393332e368172e3c4010c60583e?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f43224029fd81008db71a32b3d37e8c30.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"d2370393332e368172e3c4010c60583e","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4k","html_url":"https://github.com/k4k","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4k/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4k/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4k/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4k/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4k/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4k/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4k/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4k/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4k/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-03-21t18:11:14z","updated_at":"2013-03-21t18:12:11z","body":"this issue does seem to have been resolved by the patch in 2474. i did not have it fully implemented. i had only implemented group_ldap.php and not updater.php. after implementing updater.php i no longer experience the interface hang and subsequent mysql query looping that was causing the extraordinarily high cpu usage. for completeness i've listed the reproduction steps below and the expected and actual behavior prior to implementing the patched files.\r\n\r\n#### owncloud version: 5.0.0\r\n### expected behavior\r\ncreate, edit or delete a file within a directory of which you are the owner and which is shared to a group of which you are a member.\r\n\r\n### actual behavior\r\nupon creating, editing or deleting a file within a directory of which you are the owner and which is shared to a group of which you are a member the web interface hangs. viewing the mysql query log shows that there is what appears to be a query loop running continuously. checking top shows httpd utilizing 80% or more cpu and, if left to run for an extended period, will ultimately lead to a denial of service which prevents the system from responding to ping or http requests.\r\n\r\n### steps to reproduce\r\n1. create a directory\r\n2. share directory with a group of which you are a member\r\n3. open the newly created directory\r\n4. create a text document\r\n\r\n### fix\r\nimplement patch found in issue 2474"}]
