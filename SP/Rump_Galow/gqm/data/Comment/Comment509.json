might be a misunderstanding about the way the webdavauth app works. the idea is that the owncloud server sends the user credentials of the user to an url as http basic auth. if the other server responds with http 200 the credentials are considered valid and the user is logged in. the the other server responds with a 403 (not authorized) than the user loggin is rejected. this can be used to authenticate a user agains a remote http/webdav or owncloud server. the consequence is that if the admin configures an url that always return http 200 than every password works. so if you want to authenticate agains a second owncloud server you have to use the url that definitely sends a 403 if the credentials are wrong. this is http://\"owncloudurl\"/remote.php/webdav/ most of the
