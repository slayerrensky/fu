\"accident\" i've come to install `php5-pdo_pgsql-5.4.14`. since then, i don't have any complains in /var/log/messages.  the log errors hints that the 3rdparty mdb2 pgsql driver might be buggy (or at least inconsistant with pdo's pgsql driver).\r\n\r\nit is also to be noted that i have a line in config.php that looks like `'version' => '5.0.6',` which is confusing as i have owncloud 5.0.5 installed. as far as i understand (i.e. after a few grep magic tricks), it is the 3party mdb2 mysql driver client version (at some point i was using owncloud w/ a mysql backend). i find it really confusing and maybe the config option should be renamed to explicit the version number's origin.\r\n\r\nstill, the issue is solved, i'll leave it to you if you think relevant to investigate further on the md2 pgsql driver and/or the confusing version number. \r\n\r\nthank you for your time."}]
