info is absolutely correct. it is actually possible to sync owncloud calendar with windows phone 8 (i guess, it does not work with wp7 :-( ). i can't find a link at the moment, but it is really simple to do the trick: \r\n1. add a google account to your windows phone 8 with a fake mail address and password \r\n2. restart your phone\r\n3. change the google account to your owncloud credentials and insert card-dav/cal-dav adresses at the bottom of the settings page.\r\n\r\nworks good, besides a few things ;). \r\ni did not find out after which time the calender is syncing it's data. new events are immediately added to owncloud, but events added to the web interface are only shown after a certain time. and i also have problems with german \"umlauts\" which are not shown on windows phone. i
