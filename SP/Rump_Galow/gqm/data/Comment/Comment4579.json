the usage of non-inherited permissions (this is really the needed part) will allow to have exactly same folder tree for all across the enterprise using the owncloud. just show the folder name in the structure in case there is tree (shared folder -> restricted folder -> shared folder). the support is much easier, as admin will know what each user is viewing and having problems with.\r\nthis is a common issue how \"normal\" corporations are thinking of their folders trees:\r\nhttp://www.egnyte.com/assets/images/illustrations/640px-permissions-architecture.jpg\r\njust look how egnyte are doing that. this is exactly what is needed.\r\nhttp://www.egnyte.com/ms/egnyte-vs-box/#folder-permissions\r\nthis is not to advertise egnyte â€“ i really like the open-source owncloud solution. but you need

enough)"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/comments/30657925","html_url":"https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/4579#issuecomment-30657925","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/core/issues/4579","id":30657925,"user":{"login":"vincentthe","id":3636248,"avatar_url":"https://gravatar.com/avatar/364758b38776e57b35d28f3e6b81ed38?d=https%3a%2f%2fidenticons.github.com%2f98a10de9434bd26baac10b215015bfc2.png&r=x","gravatar_id":"364758b38776e57b35d28f3e6b81ed38","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincentthe","html_url":"https://github.com/vincentthe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincentthe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincentthe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincentthe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincentthe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincentthe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincentthe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincentthe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincentthe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincentthe/received_events","type":"user","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-12-16t12:48:37z","updated_at":"2013-12-16t12:48:37z","body":"i would like to voice my support for the initial proposal to solve this problem. in my opinion adding filters/search is an overly complex \"solution\" that doesn't solve the underlying problem. allow end-users to \"mimick\" the original folder structure or apply their own, doesn't solve the lack of control from a business perspective.\r\nin terms of the arguments brought forward earlier (\"way too complicated for user experience\") i'm quite sure the filter/search approach is much more complicated and overwhelming compared to the \"restricted access\" method.\r\n\r\nanother use case description:\r\ni'm looking to implement owncloud in a small enterprise environment. our various design and production documents have \"hands-on\" or \"signed off & accepted\" status (as required by certain iso standards). it would be kind of obvious to have both document types in their respective sub-folders of the module they are designs of. a designer working on module b would get read-only access to all \"signed off\" sub-folders for module b, and the components module b would depend on. he/she would get write access to the module b \"hands-on\" folder.\r\n\r\nif i were to implement this use case using ownclouds current authorisation mechanism, it would require me to create two separate folder structures, one for the signed off documents, and one for the work-in progress documents. great fun if there are a couple dozen projects each with tens (sometimes hundreds) of components."}]
