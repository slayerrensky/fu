In HTML5 you can <mark>mark</mark> single words or phrases!
Also the <wbr> (Word Break Opportunity) tag specifies where in a text it would be ok 
to add a line-break.
Tip: When a word is too long, or you are afraid 
that the browser will break your lines at the wrong place, 
you can use the <wbr> element to add word break opportunities.
