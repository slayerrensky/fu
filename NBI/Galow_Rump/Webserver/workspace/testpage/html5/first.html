  <h1>Why i should use an article Tag?</h1>
  <p>The article tag specifies independent, self-contained content.An article should make sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the site.
<br>Potential sources for the <article> element:
<ul>
<li>Forum post</li>
<li>Blog post</li>
<li>News story</li>
<li>Comment</li>
</p>
</article>

<p>The figure tag specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, 
diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.While the content of the figure
 element is related to the main flow, its position is independent of the 
 main flow, and if removed it should not affect the flow of the document.
